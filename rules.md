## Here is where you can find all rules and format settings specific to our fantasy football league!!

### For newcomers, returners, or anyone feeling like they need a bit of a refresher, a quick tutorial on being a fantasy football pro can be found [in the section at the bottom of this page!](#newbie-help)

### Roster settings

- One quarterback (QB)
- Two runningbacks (RBs)
- Two wide receivers (WRs)
- One tight end (TE)
- Two flex position players - can put any WR,RB, or TE in this position 
- One defense (DEF)
- Five bench spots
- **NO KICKERS** - we despise kickers. They ruin fantasy football and frequently ruin regular football as well. For anyone still holding out hope that kickers aren't the worst, this last year provided definitive proof after it became public that the greatest kicker in NFL history turned out to be... just a horrible human being. Suffice it to say, we will *never* be revising this rule.

### Scoring settings

- 4 points per passing touchdown
- -1 point per interception
- 6 points per rushing or receiving a touchdown
- 0.5 points per reception
- -2 points per fumble *lost* (no points subtracted if the fumble is not recovered by the defense)
- 6 points if your player recovers a fumble and scores a touchdown
- 2 points for passing, rushing, or receiving a 2-point conversion
- 0.04 points per passing yard (comes out to 1 point for every 25 passing yards)
- 0.1 points per rushing or receiving yard
- **Defensive scoring is a bit unique in our league, as it is nerfed to prevent large scores that can have a crazy impact on a matchup**
    - All defensive scoring starts at 5 points on the week, and -0.1 point is subtracted from this value for every real-life point that the defense allows (so your defense would need to give up over 50 points to give you a negative score)
    - Defense gets an additional point for every turnover that they force and a half-point for every sack
- 0.04 points per kick/punt return yard **implemented starting in 2024 with the changing of the kick-off in the NFL that led to more fantasy relevant players being involved in kickoff returns**
- 6 points per special teams touchdown or fumble recovery touchdown (if your player scores a touchdown of any variety, you will get a point) 

{: .box-note}
Note: Plays where a lateral occurs are scored weirdly by the NFL, this is the only situation where your player can score a touchdown and you technically might not get points for it in fantasy football... there is unfortunately no real way to rectify this due to the NFL's method of keeping stats on these plays





## Congratulations!!! You are part of the worlds greatest fantasy football league... now what? {#newbie-help}

### Drafting

The first step in your journey as a fantasy football manager will be our draft. At our draft, 
you will get the opportunity to pick out a team from players in the NFL, and your position in the draft will be determined beforehand by the current Vice Commissioner. 
There will be 14 rounds in the draft where you will get the chance to pick 14 players. Among these players, you will need to select at least one quarterback (QB), two runningbacks (RBs), 
two wide receivers (WRs), one tight end (TEs), and one defense (DEF), these players will make up your starting lineup in addition to two "flex" players that will be two additional players 
that you choose to play for your team - these "flex" players can be any WR, RB, or TE - essentially any singular positon except for quarterback.

After each round of the draft, the order of the draft will "snake" or "flip". So if you have the twelfth pick of the first round, you will have the first pick of the second round, and so on and so forth. 
This ensures that the person with the first overall pick does not have too much of and advantage, and that player talent will be more evenly distributed among the teams in the league.


Once the draft has begun, you will wait for your turn and then make your selection from all the players that remain at that point. When it is your turn the "draft" buttton will turn green, 
and clicking on this button will draft the player to your team!! Note: if you are doing this on a desktop, the draft button will be a "+" symbol. You will be given 90 seconds to make your selection, 
so act quick once it is your turn!

To prepare for your turn in the draft, you can add players to your "queue". This is done by hitting the little paper icon by a player's name:

![Queue icon](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/queue_icon.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Once you have clicked this button, the player will be added to your "queue" so that you can more easily find this player when your turn comes up. 
You can find all of your queued players underneath the "QUEUE" tab.

### TIME TO COMPETE

The draft is merely the start of the glorious journey that is the fantasy football season. After you have acquired your team to start the season through the draft, you will 
have to select which players will represent your team on any given week to earn you points in your matchup, and you will also have the opportunity to swap the players you 
drafted for new players via the waiver wire and trades with other teams in the league!

Set your lineup each weak by using the position icons next to the player names to swap out players from your bench into your starting lineup. Only points scored by these starting 
players will count towards your score in a given week.

![Sub example](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/sub_example.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

If one of your players gets injured and gets listed as "OUT" or put on the "PUP" or "IR", then you can move them to one of the IR slots that you see at the end of your bench. This will 
allow you to pick up a new player without needing to remove the now-injured player from your roster!

The main way of acquiring new players is by bidding on the remaining available players on the waiver wire. You will bid on these players using your free agent acquisition budget (FAAB) dollars. 
Everyone in the league starts the season with \$100 in FAAB, so use it wisely! You can trade for more FAAB by asking for it in a trade with another team, but otherwise, once you use all of 
your \$100, you will be left with hoping you can get players from the waiver wire with \$0 bids.

To request a trade, you can click on the trade icon next to a player's name under the PLAYERS tab, or on any of the TEAM pages. Once a trade request is made the trade can be accepted, rejected, 
or countered with an alternative trade. Our official policy with trades is _technically_ to have a 24 hour grace period after the trade request has been accepted. But in practice we simply wait 
for commissioner review and as soon as I (Commissioner Bert) see the trade and it doesn't look like there's any collusion afoot, I'll process the trade. Note: While I theoretically have veto 
power for any trade, it is very much against my fantasy football philosophy to veto any trade. I will process all trades unless it is exceedingly obvious - and there is unanimous agreement from the rest of the league - 
that a trade has been made with nefarious motivations.


### Good luck!!! And always feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!!

Now let's go have some fun!!!
