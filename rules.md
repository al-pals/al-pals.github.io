## Here is where you can find all rules and format settings specific to our fantasy football league!!

### For newcomers, returners, or anyone feeling like they need a bit of a refresher, a quick tutorial on being a fantasy football pro can be found [in the section at the bottom of this page!](#newbie-help)

### Roster settings

- One quarterback (QB)
- Two runningbacks (RBs)
- Two wide receivers (WRs)
- One tight end (TE)
- Two flex position players - can put any WR,RB, or TE in this position 
- One defense (DEF)
- Five bench spots
- **NO KICKERS** - we despise kickers. They ruin fantasy football and frequently ruin regular football as well. For anyone still holding out hope that kickers aren't the worst, this last year provided definitive proof after it became public that the greatest kicker in NFL history turned out to be... just a horrible human being. Suffice it to say, we will *never* be revising this rule.

### Scoring settings

- 4 points per passing touchdown
- -1 point per interception
- 6 points per rushing or receiving a touchdown
- -2 points per fumble *lost* (no points subtracted if the fumble is not recovered by the defense)
- 6 points if your player recovers a fumble and scores a touchdown
- 2 points for passing, rushing, or receiving a 2-point conversion
- 0.04 points per passing yard (comes out to 1 point for every 25 passing yards)
- 0.1 points per rushing or receiving yard
- **Defensive scoring is a bit unique in our league, as it is nerfed to prevent large scores that can have a crazy impact on a matchup**
    - All defensive scoring starts at 5 points on the week, and -0.1 point is subtracted from this value for every real-life point that the defense allows (so your defense would need to give up over 50 points to give you a negative score)
    - Defense gets an additional point for every turnover that they force and a half-point for every sack





## Congratulations!!! You are part of the worlds greatest fantasy football league... now what? {#newbie-help}

#### Drafting

The first step in your journey as a fantasy football manager will be our draft. At our draft, 
you will get the opportunity to pick out a team from players in the NFL, and your position in the draft will be determined beforehand by the current Vice Commissioner. 
There will be 14 rounds in the draft where you will get the chance to pick 14 players. Among these players, you will need to select at least one quarterback (QB), two runningbacks (RBs), 
two wide receivers (WRs), one tight end (TEs), and one defense (DEF), these players will make up your starting lineup in addition to two "flex" players that will be two additional players 
that you choose to play for your team - these "flex" players can be any WR, RB, or TE - essentially any singular positon except for quarterback.

After each round of the draft, the order of the draft will "snake" or "flip". So if you have the twelfth pick of the first round, you will have the first pick of the second round, and so on and so forth. 
This ensures that the person with the first overall pick does not have too much of and advantage, and that player talent will be more evenly distributed among the teams in the league.


Once the draft has begun, you will wait for your turn and then make your selection from all the players that remain at that point. When it is your turn the "draft" buttton will turn green, 
and clicking on this button will draft the player to your team!! Note: if you are doing this on a desktop, the draft button will be a "+" symbol. You will be given 90 seconds to make your selection, 
so act quick once it is your turn!

To prepare for your turn in the draft, you can add players to your "queue". This is done by hitting the little paper icon by a player's name:

Once you have clicked this button, the player will be added to your "queue" so that you can more easily find this player when your turn comes up. 
You can find all of your queued players underneath the "QUEUE" tab.
