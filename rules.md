## Here is where you can find all rules and format settings specific to our fantasy football league!!

### For newcomers, returners, or anyone feeling like they need a bit of a refresher, a quick tutorial on being a fantasy football pro can be found [in the section at the bottom of this page!](#newbie-help)

### Roster settings

- One quarterback (QB)
- Two runningbacks (RBs)
- Two wide receivers (WRs)
- One tight end (TE)
- Two flex position players - can put any WR,RB, or TE in this position 
- One defense (DEF)
- Five bench spots
- **NO KICKERS** - we despise kickers. They ruin fantasy football and frequently ruin regular football as well. For anyone still holding out hope that kickers aren't the worst, this last year provided definitive proof after it became public that the greatest kicker in NFL history turned out to be... just a horrible human being. Suffice it to say, we will *never* be revising this rule.

### Scoring settings

- 4 points per passing touchdown
- -1 point per interception
- 6 points per rushing or receiving a touchdown
- -2 points per fumble *lost* (no points subtracted if the fumble is not recovered by the defense)
- 6 points if your player recovers a fumble and scores a touchdown
- 2 points for passing, rushing, or receiving a 2-point conversion
- 0.04 points per passing yard (comes out to 1 point for every 25 passing yards)
- 0.1 points per rushing or receiving yard
- **Defensive scoring is a bit unique in our league, as it is nerfed to prevent large scores that can have a crazy impact on a matchup**
    - All defensive scoring starts at 5 points on the week, and -0.1 point is subtracted from this value for every real-life point that the defense allows (so your defense would need to give up over 50 points to give you a negative score)
    - Defense gets an additional point for every turnover that they force and a half-point for every sack





## Congratulations!!! You are part of the worlds greatest fantasy football league... now what? {#newbie-help}
