Without further adeu, my dearest pals of Als, I must insist that we begin this year by honoring our **fantabulous** reigning champion, **ALEX!!!!** &#127881; &#127870; &#127881;


Did she have brains or knowledge? **Indubitably!!**
She had an absolute abundance of ball knowledge put on full display as she conquered all of the most treacherous of challenges this league could possibly serve up. 
&#128680; _Fun fact alert_ &#128680; - over the course of the entire, storied history of this fantasy football league, **nobody** has overcome more points being scored against them and still manage to emerge victorious as league champion.
Alex isnâ€™t just a champion, she is the most determined, most resilient, most positively _ferocious_ champion this league has _ever, ever_ seen!!

Does anyone have the gumption needed to take down this dazzling dynamo?!? It will require the utmost braverism!!

That challenge begins for all of us **THIS TUESDAY** at 8PM Eastern (5PM Arizona time &#127797; and 6PM Colorado time &#127956;) with our **FANTASY FOOTBALL DRAFT**. 
Thanks to our intrepid Vice Commissioner Woody our draft order has been selected, and we are sure to get off to a _soaring_ start 
with the first pick belonging to our resident superfan of the **SUPERBOWL LIX CHAMPION** Philadelphia Eagles &#129413; &#127942; - CAITLIN!!
