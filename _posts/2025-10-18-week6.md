Forgive me, but your beloved commissioner has some personal matters to announce before we get into this week's recap.

You see, Commissioner Bert is really not a man of many talents.

Beyond the obvious fantasy football skills, the only real notable ability that the commissioner had been able to display is a knack for not flunking out of school.

For much of the last three decades, this has been sufficient for Commissioner Bert to get by. But then, after graduating from NC State this past Spring, I recieved some harrowing news... 
the powers that be had no more school for me to do.

Having run out of classes to take, what was I to do?? 

My first thought was that I can now commit to being your commmissioner full time. 

And this seemed like a great idea! After all what other job could be more fulfilling or impactful to the greater good?

Unfortunately, after extensive efforts, I have come to the realization that I cannot use my **commissioner powers** to lower the numbers remaining on our loan. 
These mortgage brokers appear to be completely immune to my sorcery.

So I needed to find a side-gig to my commissioning. And I cannot lie, this was a real struggle.

With the job markets bleak, and a lack of discernable skills, I needed a break. But then I came to a critical realization...

The fine folks at the University of North Carolina just hired a geriatric Bill Belichick that is obviously undergoing a psychological breakdown confronting his own mortality. 

The girlfriend 50 years younger than him? Not enough of a red flag.

Belichick's requirements to hire his incompetent children to important roles in the program? UNC said sure why not.

Bill's decision to hire an out of work podcaster that has never worked in college football as the general manager? UNC was fully onboard and made him the highest paid GM in college football.


This observation that UNC clearly will hire just about anyone regardless of red flags or qualifications proved absolutely critical. And was the obvious path to Commissioner Bert finding a job.

With that, I am happy to announce that your commissioner now has full time employment! And I will now be a data analyst at UNC in addition to my lifelong duties as your commissioner.

### The Drake Over

Three weeks ago Drake Maye had a show stopping performance against his childhood team -- the Carolina Panthers -- and paid homage to his favorite player, Cam Newton, with Cam's trademark Superman celebration.

Like the great Cam before him, hitting this Superman celebration unleashed something from Drake Maye. And ever since he has been *the* best quarterback in the National Football League.

"Ohh but Commissioner Bert!! What do you mean, how could he be the best QB when Josh Allen is the reigning MVP??" 

Well Drake Maye just went *to* Buffalo and beat Josh Allen head-to-head in his own stadium in primetime.

"What about Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow?? They are both perennial MVP candidates!" 

To that I say, how can either Jackson or Burrow be the best QB in football if they cannot play football due to their endless injuries?

"Well then what about Patrick Mahomes? He's clearly the most dominant quarterback when it comes to the most important thing... winning Superbowls."


Shhhh! Nobody likes Patrick Mahomes. He's boring. The actual Kermit puppet has more of a personality than Mahomes. And when I say that I don't mean Kermit the character... I mean the literal puppet... before being removed from the box that it is stored in between tapings of Sesame Street.


So, while your commissioner may have had one of the worst fantasy football teams in the entire league last year. And this year has been brutal to start. Now that I have Drake Maye (the greatest player ever to grace the gridiron), Commissioner Bert is **so back**!!!



## Chris 128.60 -- Amy 122.38

### CA Out Frats the Skatt Man

Nobody has had a more fun Thursday night than Amy did last week.

This week of Thursday night football marked the arrival and coronation of Cam Skattebo as a true fantasy football superstar.


![skatt-nvp](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/skatt-nvp.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Skattebo repeatedly launched himself skull-first, straight into the vaunted Eagles defense, with no regard for anyones safety or his own ability to perform cognitive tasks 15 years from now. And it turns out this is a shockingly successful strategy for football.

Not only did Skattebo put up an incredible 30 fantasy football points, but he also quickly became a cult hero as the frat star of the fantasy football league. A caucasian runningback that does nothing but scream incoherently and rips his shirt off like Hulk Hogan after winning the biggest football game of his life? He truly appears to be a drunk frat kid who the Giants snuck onto the football field... and is just tearing through defenses.

Heartbreakingly for Amy, despite being armed with this frat superstar, she came up against **the** frat man this week.

Yes, nobody is more well acquainted with the ways of the fratsters than Chris.

## Sophie and Dan 127.52 -- Nick 104.00 

### Jonathan Taylor Reaches Final Form

Jonathan Taylor was already an unstoppable force this season. To date he is *the* highest scoring runningback in all of fantasy football.

He was already arguably the most valuable asset in all of fantasy football, powered to these heights by his insatiable thirst for scoring touchdowns -- leading the entire NFL in touchdowns scored so far this season.

This week though? Jonathan Taylor decided scoring touchdowns was no longer enough. He was utterly determined to find a way to score more than six points at a time.

And, God help us all, he found a way...

It turns out, there is something called an "octopus" in football vernacular. Where a player scores a touchdown *and* the ensuing 2 point conversion, granting them a full **eight** points on a single possession.

BEHOLD THE MONSTROSITY!! FEAST YOUR EYES ON THE NEW JONATHAN TAYLOR!!!! HOW CAN ANYBODY STOP SOPHIE AND DAN NOW?!?

## Caitlin 113.32 -- Drew 106.44

### Powered by Brotherly Love

Not much is going right for our resident Philadelphian, Caitlin, right now when it comes to the sporting world. But we will spare her from re-litigating the painful details on these struggles because her fantasy team this past week was the source of a true heartwarming story that powered her to victory.

David Montgomery's sister, Kiki, was in a devastating car crash just last year that left her paralyzed. David has spoken at length about how challenges that Kiki has had to face, and how the strength and courage she displayed in the months following the accident not only amazed him, but reminded him of the perseverance his mother showed working three jobs to support them growing up. 

For a man who makes millions for being stronger and faster than other men, these challenges David's family has endured give him a much deeper perspective and understanding of what true strength looks like.

As you might imagine, despite being David's biggest fan, Kiki has not been able to attend one of his games since the accident. That is until this last weekend.

David and his sister grew up in Cincinnati, and Kiki still calls Cincinnati home. So since the Lions were playing at in Cincinnati this weekend, against the Bengals, it provided the chance for Kiki to see David play again for the first time in over a year.

David did not disappoint and put on an absolute show for his sister. Not only did the star runningback get in the endzone himself on a rushing touchdown, but he also threw for a touchdown to punctuate the celebration.

## Ivona 110.88 -- Albert 80.84

### Untamed Wood

Ivona's fantasy team is on an absolute tear. After a slower start to the season, Ivona is now riding a 2-game winning streak to put herself into contention for the playoffs.

Where did this sudden surge in confidence come from for her fantasy team?

Well, based on the new intel provided by Taylor Swift, it appears Ivona's Tight End Travis Kelce has a lot to be confident about!!

Just in case any of you didn't get around to listening to the new Taylor Swift album during the dIIP EP release week, the blonde mega-popstar dedicated an entire song on the album to let us all know how well-endowed her new fiance is.

Apparently Travis Kelce's got a whole "Redwood tree that aint hard to see" down there!! 

![redwood](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/redwood.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

No wonder he had to spend the entire offseason trying to learn how to run fast... how could anyone run in a straight line -- nevermind quickly -- with all of that going on!

It appears that this big d\*\*\* energy was the key to Ivona's team reaching new heights and challenging for a fantasy football championship.




## Alex 102.26 -- Amy 83.08

### Family Bakery

The dreaded mother-daughter showdown came once again!! This time the Venuto girls both came into the matchup coming off of strong victories.

For Amy, the recent victory was a much-needed respite from an otherwise torturous start to the fantasy season.

In spite of a struggling start to the season, Amy needed only to look at her daughter for hope that a fantasy season could be turned around!

After starting her season winless through the first two weeks, Alex had flipped a switch and had not lost since. Even when the odds feel long, you can never count yourself out!

Unfortunately for Amy, while Alex could have been a source for hope, Baker Mayfield is a bit of a school ground bully.

You thought this could be a nice family afair where we decide that all of the Venutos should be feeling good about their fantasy season going into week 6??

This Baker says "NO!!! Alex's winning streak shall not be deterred!"

![Family Baker](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/family_baker.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

What's worse for Amy, Baker Mayfield had to do this while donning what might be the best uniforms in the NFL this year... those Tampa Bay 1976 retros. It's one thing to lose on the gridiron, it's another to simultaneously lose on the runway.
