Forgive me, but your beloved commissioner has some personal matters to announce before we get into this week's recap.

You see, Commissioner Bert is really not a man of many talents.

Beyond the obvious fantasy football skills, the only real notable ability that the commissioner had been able to display is a knack for not flunking out of school.

For much of the last three decades, this has been sufficient for Commissioner Bert to get by. But then, after graduating from NC State this past Spring, I recieved some harrowing news... 
the powers that be had no more school for me to do.

Having run out of classes to take, what was I to do?? 

My first thought was that I can now commit to being your commmissioner full time. 

And this seemed like a great idea! After all what other job could be more fulfilling or impactful to the greater good?

Unfortunately, after extensive efforts, I have come to the realization that I cannot use my **commissioner powers** to lower the numbers remaining on our loan. 
These mortgage brokers appear to be completely immune to my sorcery.

So I needed to find a side-gig to my commissioning. And I cannot lie, this was a real struggle.

With the job markets bleak, and a lack of discernable skills, I needed a break. But then I came to a critical realization...

The fine folks at the University of North Carolina just hired a geriatric Bill Belichick that is obviously undergoing a psychological breakdown confronting his own mortality. 

The girlfriend 50 years younger than him? Not enough of a red flag.

Belichick's requirements to hire his incompetent children to important roles in the program? UNC said sure why not.

Bill's decision to hire an out of work podcaster that has never worked in college football as the general manager? UNC was fully onboard and made him the highest paid GM in college football.


This observation that UNC clearly will hire just about anyone regardless of red flags or qualifications proved absolutely critical. And was the obvious path to Commissioner Bert finding a job.

With that, I am happy to announce that your commissioner now has full time employment! And I will now be a data analyst at UNC in addition to my lifelong duties as your commissioner.

### The Drake Over

Three weeks ago Drake Maye had a show stopping performance against his childhood team -- the Carolina Panthers -- and paid homage to his favorite player, Cam Newton, with Cam's trademark Superman celebration.

Like the great Cam before him, hitting this Superman celebration unleashed something from Drake Maye. And ever since he has been *the* best quarterback in the National Football League.

"Ohh but Commissioner Bert!! What do you mean, how could he be the best QB when Josh Allen is the reigning MVP??" 

Well Drake Maye just went *to* Buffalo and beat Josh Allen head-to-head in his own stadium in primetime.

"What about Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow?? They are both perennial MVP candidates!" 

To that I say, how can either Jackson or Burrow be the best QB in football if they cannot play football due to their endless injuries?

"Well then what about Patrick Mahomes? He's clearly the most dominant quarterback when it comes to the most important thing... winning Superbowls."


Shhhh! Nobody likes Patrick Mahomes. He's boring. The actual Kermit puppet has more of a personality than Mahomes. And when I say that I don't mean Kermit the character... I mean the literal puppet... before being removed from the box that it is stored in between tapings of Sesame Street.


So, while your commissioner may have had one of the worst fantasy football teams in the entire league last year. And this year has been brutal to start. Now that I have Drake Maye (the greatest player ever to grace the gridiron), Commissioner Bert is **so back**!!!



## Chris 128.60 -- Amy 122.38

### CA Out Frats the Skatt Man

Nobody has had a more fun Thursday night than Amy did last week.

This week of Thursday night football marked the arrival and coronation of Cam Skattebo as a true fantasy football superstar.


![skatt-nvp](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/skatt-nvp.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Skattebo repeatedly launched himself skull-first, straight into the vaunted Eagles defense, with no regard for anyones safety or his own ability to perform cognitive tasks 15 years from now. And it turns out this is a shockingly successful strategy for football.

Not only did Skattebo put up an incredible 30 fantasy football points, but he also quickly became a cult hero as the frat star of the fantasy football league. A smash-mouth running back that does nothing but scream incoherently and rips his shirt off like Hulk Hogan after winning the biggest football game of his life? He truly appears to be a drunk frat kid who the Giants snuck onto the football field... and is just tearing through defenses.

Heartbreakingly for Amy, despite being armed with this frat superstar, she came up against **the** frat man this week.

Yes, nobody is more well acquainted with the ways of the fratsters than Chris. In fact, I can hear Chris now as I type this, outraged that I have been using the short hand "frat" to refer to fraternities. 

Skattebo's were no match for Chris this week. But luckily for Amy, there's no stopping Skattebo now. 

## Sam and James 115.48 -- Caitlin 87.04

### Foiled by Jaxons

Caitlin had a rather painful sports week.


We won't even delve into the Kerkering collapse here, but rest assured the baseball season found an uncommonly cruel way to end for the city of Philadelphia. But then came the undoing by the Eagles and Caitlin's fantasy team by two guys named Jaxon. 

Is spelling "Jackson" with an "x" cool and hip? Or douchey? 

Whatever your answer to these questions might be, after Jaxson Dart handed the Eagles first division loss of their season, and then Jaxon Smith-Njigba dismantled the hopes of Caitlin's fantasy team, I can't imagine she's a very big fan of the trend. 

Meanwhile, Sam and James are hitting their stride in the fantasy season just in time for the return of CeeDee Lamb. 

And with the emergence of the aforementioned Jaxon Smith-Njigba as a top 5 wide receiver in fantasy football, Sam and James have the most formidable WR duo in the entire league. 


## Drew 112.64 -- Nic 53.24

### Check his Vidals There's Signs of Life Here

The last time a man came back from looking this dead it gave rise to an entire religion. 

Nobody has seen more catastrophic injury luck than Drew has this year losing Malik Nabers and Tyreek Hill to season-ending injuries within hours of eachother. 

Yet just when you might've thought he could be counted out of the playoff hunt, Drew rallied his team and pulled off the upset of the week.

Drew's roster may not be sexy. A cobbled hodge-podge of players that have stepped into starting roles due to injuries on their respective NFL rosters. Nevertheless, Wandale Robinson and Kimani Vidal proved this weekend that they are up to the task of securing fantasy football victories. 

Nic came into this matchup sitting at the number one spot in the league standings. With but a single loss on his record, while Drew had just one win and a decimated team. But, against all odds, it was Drew coming out the other end with the near 60 point blow out victory. 


## Ivona 110.08 -- Armon 108.16

### Travis and His Showboys Are on Fire

DON'T LOOK NOW!
