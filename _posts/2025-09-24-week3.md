**JUSTICE SERVED?!?**

After the first two weeks of the fantasy football season were marred -- positively marinated -- in the most *scandalocious* 
controversy. Whispers of a sinister plot to stifle the success of women in the league have filled the air since the calendar turned to September.

When we last spoke, Vice Commissioner Woody had been apprehended and brought in for questioning by the authorities for his *alleged* involvement in a *possible* plot to undermine the women of this fantasy football league.

A consequence of this is that Week 3 represented an amazing opportunity. If the struggles of the women in the league continued while Woody detained, our dear Vice Commissioner would have clear alibi. 
After all, how could he possibly manipulate the league while he was under such heavy surveilance??

Unfortunately for Woody, the results of Week 3 were damning. The women of the league finally broke through as Sophie, Alex, *and* Caitlin broke through with victories this week.

Rest assured everybody, the authorities who had taken Woody in for questioning handed down **swift and certain punishment** to Woody for his alleged misogynistic machinations.

In case there was any mystery, it was Maggie who served as the aforementioned "authorities" in charge of assessing Woody's guilt and administering punishments.


## Nic 143.94 -- Sam and James 76.06

### Silence of the Lamb

What is this monstrosity -- this gargantuan juggernaut -- of a team that Nicholas has assembled?! How did the league rules allow for this roster to be constructed??

Nic has managed to amass a roster that includes an MVP at quarterback in Lamar Jackson, arguably the most desirable runningback in fantasy football in Jahmyr Gibbs, and 
just when everyone was ready to write off AJ Brown (AJ BROWN??) this year, AJ reminds all of us that he is among the most talented receivers playing football with a near 20 point performance.

I am starting to believe that there must be some nefarious explanation behind how Nic has built this team... for those not in the know Nic rather quickly updated his team name this year to 
reference a *spicy* piece of breaking news in the sporting world. It has recently been unearthed by one Pablo Torre that Steve Balmer, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, has been 
*allegedly* providing additional multi-million dollar payments to his superstar forward and best player, Kawhi Leonard, through a sham company -- thus circumventing the **very strict** 
NBA salary cap rules.

So the question must arise... was Nic just being his usual clever silly self when he changed his team name to reference these shenanigans by Steve Balmer and the Clippers organization? 
Or was this the only way that he felt comfortable confessing for his own sins of circumventing our league's roster construction rules?!

As for poor Sam and James, they had to contend with this (possibly cheating) overpowered fantasy football team while losing their best player, CeeDee Lamb to a serious ankle injury before he registered a single point!



## Alex 135.32 -- Albert 83.84

### WitchKraft No Match for the Pillaging Vikings


Well... this is just a tad embarrassing. Just last week I was all brash and obnoxious talking about how Tucker Kraft -- my agent of #witchKraft -- should strike fear into the heart of anyone who dared to challenge me this year.

And wouldn't you look at that this very next week my boy Tucker got outscored by **over twenty points** by Alex's tight end... **Hunter Henry**??

Ohh and the cruelest part of this public humilation? My dear quarterback Drake Maye was the one passing Hunter Henry *two* touchdowns. And now Hunter Henry... *yes Hunter Henry* is leading all tight ends 
in fantasy football points so far this season.

And yet, Hunter Henry was but a fraction of the embarrassment I had to endure this weekend as I got absolutely throttled by my beloved wife in fantasy football. Ohh no not even close.

As a consequence of the heart-wrenching season-ending toe injury suffered by Joe Burrow just a week ago, I was left relying on Jake Browning to ensure my best player, Ja'marr Chase could still 
produce for me in fantasy football. Lets just say ole Jakey's first start of the season did not really facilitate such success. 

Actually no I have way more to say, because Jake Browning did far more than just fail to allow for Jamarr Chase to be successful. 
As he was matched up against the Minnesota Vikings defense, who just happen to be on Alex's fantasy squad, Jake Brownings ineptitude helped facilitate an additional *twenty three* points getting scored *against* me... 
by the Vikings defense.

Please no questions at this time, your commissioner is very unwell after enduring this marital humiliation.


## Caitlin 132.84 -- Armon 114.90

### Jordan Davis Runs the Beerfest Dry

Armon's team looked absolutely unstoppable through the first two weeks of the fantasy football season. 

Twas the Year of Beer after all!!! Justin Herbert's newfound level of supreme excellence was taking the league by storm and there appeared to be nothing we could do to contain this force of nature.

But then came Jordan Davis.

This 6-foot-6, *336 pound* behemoth of a man has never met a beer he couldn't crush and the Beer-a-palooza that was Armon's start to the fantasy season was no different.

In the closing seconds of the Eagles vs. Rams game, as the Rams went for a game winning field goal. Jordan Davis, despite being a colossus of a human being lept over the Rams special teams blockers, 
blocked the would-be game winning field goal, and then -- no didn't stop there -- proceeded to retrieve the ball and run the ball all the way back for a touchdown... **while holding a beer to rub it in against Armon**.

The craziest part of Jordan Davis' touchdown return was that -- despite weighing roughly *one sixth of a ton* Davis reached speeds exceeding 18.5 miles per hour. 
For perspective, that is faster than any speed Tom Brady ever reached in his 23 year NFL career!!

What an amazing week for Caitlin. Not only did her Eagles win the most exciting football game of the NFL weekend, Jordan Davis knew that he needed to return the blocked field goal for a touchdown so that the Eagles D/ST would get all 
of those extra fantasy points.


## Sophie and Dan 112.32 -- Ivona 72.72

### Taylor Stampedes Kelce

Travy has gotten ohh so comfortable with his Taylor. Wedding bells are a-ringing and [Travis' mom Donna has reportedly already begun pressuring the couple to start having children!!](https://www.eonline.com/news/1422870/donna-kelce-on-taylor-swift-travis-kelce-having-kids)

But the universe has a funny way of finding balance in all of our lives.  And just as one Taylor transforms Travis Kelce's life for the better, here comes another Taylor to devastate his life and the lives of the rest of Ivona's fantasy team.

![Travis jonathan taylor](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/travis_jonathan_taylor.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Jonathan Taylor, once a consensus-number-one draft pick in fantasy football has seen his reputation decline in recent years thanks to the constant foibles of the Indianapolis Colts offense. 
But it appears that this year, this Taylor is in *his* Reputation era.

Taylor has been *the* number one top scoring running back in back-to-back weeks, and there are positively zero reasons to expect him to slow down in any way. 
This Colts' showpony has galloped for over 100 yards in each of the last two games and this week added on a full hat-trick with three rushing touchdowns.


## Chris 106.32 -- Drew 73.38

### Nabers Gone Fishing for New QB

Death. Taxes. And Josh Allen outscoring your fantasy football quarterback by double digit points.

This was once again the fate of Chris' opponent this fantasy season, as Drew's Michael Penix appeared to be incapable of hitting water if he fell out of a boat.

What's worse, Penix had a quote later this week in an interview where he said ["I gotta throw the ball to the wide open recievers when they're open."](https://x.com/japatrick200/status/1970897244812390846). 
By gosh I think you might just be onto something there with that one Michael!! Let's see how these adjustments turn out for him next week (commissioner's editing note: am i being overly critical of Penix because his struggles have made *my* Drake London draft pick look that much worse? you bet your butts.)

As for the rest of Drew's team, it would have been truly sublime if his best player, Malik Nabers, could step up as he was facing this cavernous quarterback disadvantage.

But *nope*. The Giants offense was utterly abysmal this week. Russell Wilson likely saw his entire career come to a sputtering end as he could not connect with Malik Nabers *nor* find the endzone as he threw two picks and promptly got benched after the game. 

In the grand scheme of things, what a truly bittersweet way for the world's biggest Russell Wilson fan, Chris, to secure a fantasy football win this week. 
Drew not having the Malik Nabers points rendered him uncompetetive and ensured Chris' victory, but at what cost?? Has Chris now seen Russ cook for the last time?!

As for Nabers, he will now be hoping his season can get back on track with rookie quarterback, Jaxson Dart, now throwing him passes for the foreseeable future. 
While Dart flashed in the preseason, his eccentric fashion choices and personality hover on the borderline of confidence-inspiring and cringe -- so perhaps Russell Wilson was the perfect mentor all along.

## Nick 85.24 -- Amy 80.88

### Trade Partnership Goes South


Nick and Amy had formed the strongest trade aliance of this young fantasy football season. While this is all built off one trade, what a trade it was!! 

This absolute blockbuster of a trade saw Amy's *first round pick*, Ashton Jeanty, get sent to Nick in exchange for 
the second-highest-drafted tight end in our league, Trey McBride. Two of the far-and-away most hyped and coveted players coming into this season swapped teams.

And based on the early returns, it certainly appears that Amy has come out on the better end of this trade. 
Trey McBride is living up to his hype as a top 5 tight end in fantasy and the number one offensive weapon for the Arizona Cardinals this year. 

Ashton Jeanty, on the other hand, has continued to put up some unsightly efficiency numbers on his opportunities as a runningback in his rookie season. 
Despite getting a strong allotment of carries and targets, Ashton Jeanty has failed to get over 64 yards in any one game this year, and has only managed to crack the endzone once for a touchdown.


Unfortunately for Amy, while it appears that for now she has won the trade, she lost the war this week as her and Nick engaged in full-scale battle. 

Amy's struggles in the quarterback department continued this week. After licking her wounds from the JJ McCarthy experience a week ago, she turned to Jaguar quarterback Trevor Lawrence. 
And poor Amy was certainly left feeling deja-vu this week, as this week it is Trevor Lawrence getting maligned for being not only a fraud but the cause of all of the struggles of the Jacksonville Jaguars organization. 

Luckily for Trevor, he did not have Carson Wentz waiting in the wings to steal his job. And so unlike JJ McCarthy, Lawrence will get the opportunity to turn his season around in week 4!
