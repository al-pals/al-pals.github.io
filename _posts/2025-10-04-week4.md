HELLO EVERYONE!!! Our sincerest apologies for our tardiness (and minimal graphics) this week. It was truly a momentus week with *so* much going on. 

For those of you not in the know, not only was it the birthday week of our **REIGNING CHAMPION ALEX** (HAPPY THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY!!), but it was also a rather huge music week.

After months of easter eggs and excitement, this was also the release week for a musical masterpiece that some are already speculating will fundamentally shake the industry.

That is right, **the dIIP EP from our own Nick Fenger dropped this week**!!!

I encourage all of you to give Nick's EP a listen!! You can listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2vix6yYxJTLcKiYFhmVb1g?si=TIExjtIATHaRnSApk1yqkw), [Youtube](https://youtu.be/_2IB9veDDDI?feature=shared), or [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/nick-fenger-655414123/sets/diip?si=e0172959a8124621bcc211a15e8765f0&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing).

I hear he has a bit of competition on the streaming platforms this week?

Nick was not the only one accomplishing great things this last week, let's recap the amazing accomplishments of all of our winners from week 4!!


## Chris 136.66 -- Albert 131.42

### Not so Slim Pickens

Chris was already undfeated. He already had the best quarterback in fantasy football in Josh Allen, and the best fantasy running back in Bijan Robinson. He had a formidable force of a team.

And in spite of coming up against this behemoth of a team, your beloved commissioner gave Chris a true test. Thanks largely to our Vice Commissioner's brother-in-name, Woody Marks breaking 
out as the new lead running back for the Houston Texans, I gained a significant lead on Chris through the day games on Sunday.

Then George Pickens' made his official arrival as the number one reciever for the Dallas Cowboys and Chris' team evolved like a Pokemon into it's strongest form.

With CeeDee Lamb sidelined by injury, the Pittsburgh Steelers outcast Pickens found himself with a remarkable opportunity in the most pass-heavy offense in the National Football League. 
And he absolutely took full advantage.

While it is great to see George live out his dreams, the rest of us really need CeeDee Lamb to get healthy soon... because if George Pickens continues to emerge as a top 5 wide receiver in all of fantasy football, all hope for any of us defeating Chris will be lost.


## Alex 126.06 -- Armon 124.32

### The Running of the Backs


So much has changed about the game of football. It all started with the advent of the forward pass, and the slippery slope to reshaping the sport has not stopped ever since.

Some have welcomed this evolution of the game. The acrobatic athleticism of the modern wide reciever, as though they are ballerinas in cleats, is truly a sight to behold. And the masterful coordination between these gazelle-like men and the quarterbacks in the NFL today is hard to fully comprehend.

Alex and Armon? They think this is all soft and ruining the culture of the sport -- nay the country!!!

Both Alex and Armon have assembled the two most impressive collections of running backs in our fantasy league. And when these two groups of warriors faced off this week, they put on a show that would've made the gladiators of yore proud.

This matchup saw **four** different running back score over 20 fantasy points!! In total, the 6 running backs that were started by Alex and Armon combined to score over 121 fantasy points... actually preposterous.

In the end it was Alex who emerged victorious from this grudge match of running backs thanks to the rookie Omarion Hampton *finally* showing his ability to be a star.



## Sophie and Dan 120.34 -- Caitlin 98.20

### Resurgent Nix

This matchup saw two teams trading punch for punch. Saquon goes off for Caitlin? Jonathan Taylor responds for Sophie and Dan. Tyler Warren goes off for Sophie and Dan? Dallas Goeddert does his part to ensure Caitlin keeps pace.

The one area that appeared like a disadvantage heading into the week was Bo Nix trying to do his part for Sophie and Dan while Caitlin had *Jalen Hurts* at her disposal.

And even though Bo has had a shaky start to his season, let me tell you, Nix haven't felt this back since Jalen Brunson got traded to New York.

Bo went off for over three hundred yards and three touchdowns to not only keep pace with Jalen Hurts, but even *outscore* him!! Helping lift Sophie and Dan to the win over Caitlin and all the way to **third** in the league standings!


## Ivona 111.58 -- Nic 96.98

### It's a Puka Party!!

Nic's quarterback is in dire straights. Lamar Jackson, one season after arguably being robbed of the NFL MVP award, is starting to have everything collapse around him.

After two absolutley heart-wrenching losses for Lamar's Ravens and an absolute anihilation at the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs, people all over NFL media are starting to wonder what will break first: Lamar's body or his spirit. He left this game against the Chiefs early with an apparent hamstring injury, but the vibes are so horrible for Baltimore that folks dared to consider whether the MVP was losing his competitive spirit. Now that it has been confirmed the hamstring injury was real and serious, the Raven's season -- and by extension Lamar's and Nic's seasons -- may hang in the balance.

On the flipside? It appears that Ivona made the absolute best pick in our fantasy football draft by selecting Puka Nacua **in the second round**!!

Expert consensus rankings now place Puka Nacua as the most valuable player in all of fantasy football, and Ivona was able to land him *and* the first gentleman of Taylor Nation with her first two picks.

What can't she do!!!

## Nick 105.28 -- Drew 100.14

### Comlete and Utter Catastrophe

Sound the trumpets, light the arrows, lower the colors... whatever your method for handling grave tragedy of a funeral. It feels like it may be time for Drew.

I've played fantasy football in some form or fashion for over two decades now. In all that time I've never seen a more catastrophic demise of a fantasy football roster.

Within hours of losing his best player for the remainder of the season with Malik Nabers suffering a multiple-ligament tearing knee injury, Drew's Tyreek Hill suffered one of the most gruesome knee injuries I have ever seen from the violent sport of football.

Tyreek's injury required an emergency rush to the hospital to save his leg from needing to be amputated and in order to restore his leg from nerve damage.

While there are certainly more sympathetic figures than Tyreek Hill that this could have happened to, few incidents have been harder to watch on a football field.

Can Drew rebound from this utter decimation of his roster? If anyone has the fantasy football savvy to do it, it is the fantasy manager who has scored more points over the whole course of our league's existence. 

Once again, to the strongest soldiers, fall the toughest battles.



## Amy 102.56 -- Sam and James 76.60

### Bucking Early Trends


There is no sugar coating it, Amy's season has gotten off to a brutally tough start.

She came into week four despearately looking for her first win, and a hero emerged in Bucky Irving!!

Bucky totalled over 100 yards just through the air, and added a touchdown to throttle Amy to a victory over Sam and James' roster that remains vulnerable without a healthy CeeDee Lamb!!

The tragic part of all of this??

Just after Bucky Irving put forth this heroic effort for Amy, he got poppped with a vicious hit as the clock was running out on the football game that resulted in a shoulder injury that will sideline him for a minimum of two weeks.

And just like that, Amy is once again on the rollercoaster that is the life of all of us fantasy football players. For every feeling of exhiliration and joy we start to feel, this game will find a way to visit humility -- or even devastation -- upon us once again.
