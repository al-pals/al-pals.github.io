MOMENTUM HAS SHIFTED!!! 

The message sent by Maggie's punishment of our Vice Commissioner has perfectly coincided with a true resurgence of the women of our fantasy football league.

In spite of the dismal start to the season, Sophie, Alex, and Caitlin are currently in position to claim one half of the playoff bids in our league, and three different women -- Alex, Sophie, and Ivona -- are riding high with multi-game winning streaks.

The tide has absolutely turned, and Vice Commissioner Woody is fully on board!!

Now, might Woody's over exuberance as an ally of feminism be partly motivated out of fear of further punishment from his eldest sister? 

It certainly can't be ruled out, but to be honest, whatever his motivation, he does appear like he's set to be on the right side of history with the nuclear ascension of the women in our league!!


## Armon 139.54 -- Sam and James 122.92

### Rico Suave Kicks Off Oktoberfest

After a truly incandescent start to the season, Armon appeared like an unstoppable force. It was the "Year of Beer" as popstar Madison Beer had appeared to lift Justin Herbert to a new level of excellence ready to dominate the fantasy season.

Then... Armon's season hit a lull in late September.

Both Caitlin and Alex did their part to hit the brakes on this "Year of Beer", handing Armon two consecutive losses.

It appeared to be the case that the Villanova grad girlies do not have any tolerance for Madison Beer's shenanigans. Which was a problem for Armon, because he had yet another Villanova alumnus in Sam facing off against him in week 5.

And Sam and James emphatically held up their end of the bargain to continue this streak of losses for Armon! Unleashing three different players who cracked 20 fantasy points.

Armon needed someone to revive his season... and then came RRRRRRRRRIIICCCOOOOOOO!!!!!

That's right!! Rico Dowdle stepped up in place of the injured Chuba Hubbard, and revived the Year of Beer just in time for Oktoberfest.

Rico led all fantasy football players in scoring this week with over 30 fantasy points, and catapulted Armon to being the highest scoring manager *yet again*.

It may take a few weeks for Armon to recover in the overall standings, but he fully appears to be the favorite to take home the league title once again.




## Nic 139.16 -- Chris 105.02

### Lone Bright Spot in the Carolina Blue Skies


In the year of our lord 2025, "UNC" and the word "football" can seldom be fit into a sentence that isn't dripping with embarrassment and humilitation.

You may be thinking that Drake Maye, as a former UNC player may serve as an exception to this trend. But no, we are no longer allowed to associate any active New England Patriots 
with the University of North Carolina, lest we get prosecuted for thought crimes by his majesty William Belichick and his concubine partner in crime.

No. There is truly only one man fighting and clawing to help UNC football retain any semblance of dignity. And that man would be Javonte Williams.

Javonte has worn many hats throughout his life.

High school valedictorian, middle linebacker, converted practice team runningback, team captain.

But his ability to rehabilitate his career to emerge as a star, workhorse runningback for the highest-scoring offense in the NFL, just in time to be a source of happiness and pride for us Carolina football fans in our darkest hour... this may be his greatest feat.

Nic's unyeilding faith in Javonte was rewarded once again this week to the tune of a massive victory over Chris. Heading into this matchup, Chris was the lone undefeated  once again get rewarded for his faith in Javonte this week, but he managed to dethrone the previously undefeated Chris from the top spot in our league standings!!



## Sophie and Dan 127.52 -- Nick 104.00 

### Jonathan Taylor Reaches Final Form

Jonathan Taylor was already an unstoppable force this season. To date he is *the* highest scoring runningback in all of fantasy football.

He was already arguably the most valuable asset in all of fantasy football, powered to these heights by his insatiable thirst for scoring touchdowns -- leading the entire NFL in touchdowns scored so far this season.

This week though? Jonathan Taylor decided scoring touchdowns was no longer enough. He was utterly determined to find a way to score more than six points at a time.

And, God help us all, he found a way...

It turns out, there is something called an "octopus" in football vernacular. Where a player scores a touchdown *and* the ensuing 2 point conversion, granting them a full **eight** points on a single possession.

BEHOLD THE MONSTROSITY!! FEAST YOUR EYES ON THE NEW JONATHAN TAYLOR!!!! HOW CAN ANYBODY STOP SOPHIE AND DAN NOW?!?

## Caitlin 113.32 -- Drew 106.44

### Powered by Brotherly Love

Not much is going right for our resident Philadelphian, Caitlin, right now when it comes to the sporting world. But we will spare her from re-litigating the painful details on these struggles because her fantasy team this past week was the source of a true heartwarming story that powered her to victory.

David Montgomery's sister, Kiki, was in a devastating car crash just last year that left her paralyzed. David has spoken at length about how challenges that Kiki has had to face, and how the strength and courage she displayed in the months following the accident not only amazed him, but reminded him of the perseverance his mother showed working three jobs to support them growing up. 

For a man who makes millions for being stronger and faster than other men, these challenges David's family has endured give him a much deeper perspective and understanding of what true strength looks like.

As you might imagine, despite being David's biggest fan, Kiki has not been able to attend one of his games since the accident. That is until this last weekend.

David and his sister grew up in Cincinnati, and Kiki still calls Cincinnati home. So since the Lions were playing at in Cincinnati this weekend, against the Bengals, it provided the chance for Kiki to see David play again for the first time in over a year.

David did not disappoint and put on an absolute show for his sister. Not only did the star runningback get in the endzone himself on a rushing touchdown, but he also threw for a touchdown to punctuate the celebration.

## Ivona 110.88 -- Albert 80.84

### Untamed Wood

Ivona's fantasy team is on an absolute tear. After a slower start to the season, Ivona is now riding a 2-game winning streak to put herself into contention for the playoffs.

Where did this sudden surge in confidence come from for her fantasy team?

Well, based on the new intel provided by Taylor Swift, it appears Ivona's Tight End Travis Kelce has a lot to be confident about!!

Just in case any of you didn't get around to listening to the new Taylor Swift album during the dIIP EP release week, the blonde mega-popstar dedicated an entire song on the album to let us all know how well-endowed her new fiance is.

Apparently Travis Kelce's got a whole "Redwood tree that aint hard to see" down there!! 

![redwood](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/redwood.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

No wonder he had to spend the entire offseason trying to learn how to run fast... how could anyone run in a straight line -- nevermind quickly -- with all of that going on!

It appears that this big d\*\*\* energy was the key to Ivona's team reaching new heights and challenging for a fantasy football championship.




## Alex 102.26 -- Amy 83.08

### Family Bakery

The dreaded mother-daughter showdown came once again!! This time the Venuto girls both came into the matchup coming off of strong victories.

For Amy, the recent victory was a much-needed respite from an otherwise torturous start to the fantasy season.

In spite of a struggling start to the season, Amy needed only to look at her daughter for hope that a fantasy season could be turned around!

After starting her season winless through the first two weeks, Alex had flipped a switch and had not lost since. Even when the odds feel long, you can never count yourself out!

Unfortunately for Amy, while Alex could have been a source for hope, Baker Mayfield is a bit of a school ground bully.

You thought this could be a nice family afair where we decide that all of the Venutos should be feeling good about their fantasy season going into week 6??

This Baker says "NO!!! Alex's winning streak shall not be deterred!"

![Family Baker](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/family_baker.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

What's worse for Amy, Baker Mayfield had to do this while donning what might be the best uniforms in the NFL this year... those Tampa Bay 1976 retros. It's one thing to lose on the gridiron, it's another to simultaneously lose on the runway.
