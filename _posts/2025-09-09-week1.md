WEEK 1 IS IN THE BOOKS!!! And what a fantastical week of chaos it was! We had some splendiferous displays of brilliance, and some horrific heartbreak already as well. 
**But remember!!** It is only week one! We have merely begun the joyously terrifying ride on the roller coaster of the fantasy football season. 
Nobody is ever truly as safe or as lost as they may feel in this _wicked_ game, especially after one week.

&#128680; **BREAKING NEWS** &#128680; -- Of the many notable developments from the first week of fantasy football, perhaps the most _scandalocious_ is the collapse of 
feminine dominance that _defined_ last year's fantasy season. 

Sophie and Sam were able to secure victories in week 1 with their co-managed teams, but all of the remaining teams managed by women 
came out on the losing end of their week 1 match-ups!!


How could this possibly be happening after the women of this league proved their superior fantasy football prowess just last year?! 

Many are begining to speculate that this is the result of Woody replacing Maggie as the league's Vice Commissioner heading into this season. 
Rumors are swirling about Woody being a potential mysoginist 
working covertly to imbue our league with patriarchal dominance. &#128561; 

Pictures have even begun to surface of Woody _allegedly_ smacking his own mother in the **face** with his tail &#128563; (pictured below)... 
how deep might this misogyny go?!

With respect to these allegations, Vice Commissioner Woody has elected not to comment at this time.

While this investigation must remain ongoing, let's recap an incredible week of excitement, anguish, and intrigue!!

## Armon 131.82 -- Amy 86.62

### Justin Herbert MVP Season Brewing??

The biggest story of the first week of fantasy football is the emergence a brand-new, bedazzled front-runner for the championship, ARMON!! 

Galavanting to success powered by a potential breakout campaign from Chargers Quarterback Justin Herbert. 

For _the_ longest time Justin Herbert has been a darling of analytics nerds and football film gurus. But let's be honest, he has remained disrespected and easily dismissed because he repeatedly 
failed to win on the big stage and just could not put up the stats of the true **elite** quarterbacks. 

Well, our boy Justin is not one to rest on his laurels. 

He knew he had all of the quarterback skills, but what could he possibly be missing that was preventing him from becoming an Hall-of-Fame, MVP level player? 

After taking the offseason to study 
other elite players around the league, looking at superstars like the MVP Josh Allen and Hall-of-Fame Superbowl Champions like Travis Kelce... it was clear what needed to be done.

What made Josh Allen an MVP level quarterback after struggling early in his career? _Obviousssssly_ it was dating (and then marrying!) the dazzling pop star and film icon Hailey Steinfeld.

And then there’s Travis Kelce -- the tightest of tight ends, fantasy football's crown jewel at the position for over a decade. His secret ingredient? 
Oh nothing much… just romancing the most famous pop star -- nay person -- in the entire world, the one, the only, _the_ showgirl, Taylor Swift.

Justin understood the assignment... behold the year of the Beer. &#127867; Pop star Madison Beer has entered the chat.

![Beer herbert rummikub](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/beer_herbert_rummikub.JPG){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

After weeks of wooing Madison with his prowess in chess and rummikub (yes, board games can be romantic, who knew?! Justin knew), it has now been confirmed that Justin Herbert’s board game brilliance has 
facilitated a blossoming relationship with the pop-star. And the results on the football field could not have been more immediate for Herbert. 

Herbert not only outdueled Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce in prime time of week one, but he put up the 
third best fantasy performance among all quarterbacks this week _while going against the vaunted Chiefs defense in Brazil_. 

If the rest of you aren't positively terrified of this fantasy football weapon that Armon has at his disposal, you probably should be!

Unfortunately for Amy, she was on the wrong end of this opening weekend breakout for Armon and Justin Herbert. And her own quarterback Trevor Lawrence did not help matters, as he simply could not connect 
on any passes further than 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. Perhaps Trevor can convince his high-school-sweetheart and loving wife Marissa that she should persue a musical career of her own?


## Nic 120.66 -- Albert 89.60

### Forgot About Javonte


WHERE -- ohh where -- WAS THE LOYALTY?! Just three short years ago, Javonte Williams was a budding fantasy football &#10024; _superstar_ &#10024;. After breaking records for the number of missed tackles he forced as a rookie, the 
hype train was &#128642; _choo-choo-ing_ ahead at full throttle into his sophomore campaign. 

And then came catastrophe. 

An utterly gruesome knee injury that was as devastating as any that we have seen in the 
last decade of NFL football. 

SHOCKINGLY, Javonte was not his former self upon returning from this injury. He was slower, struggled to break tackles, and ultimately Sean Payton and the Denver Broncos gave up on him. Now, 
while I might understand why the Broncos gave up on Javonte, what is positivley disappointifying is that WE gave up on Javonte. A league with not one, not two, but _five_ Tar Heels let Javonte 
fall all the way to the _NINTH_ round! __NINTH!!!__ What an abomination!!

One Tar Heel did step up, though, and showed that his Carolina blue roots have survived his move to the desert. Not only did Nic step up and show his loyalty to Javonte by drafting him, 
he did so knowing full well he was running a massive risk by drafting the Dallas Cowboy runningback while his dear Caitlin would look on in judgement for drafting a player from her Eagles' 
archrivals.

Nic believed in Javonte when nobody else did, and now he is set to be the beneficiary of his revenge tour. A tour that started with yours truly as he set the tone for the fantasy football 
season, scoring the first touchdown of the year and instantly squashing all hopes of victory for your commissioner.


![Forgot about javonte](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/forgot_about_javonte.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}


With a resurgent Javonte and MVP candidate Lamar Jackson, Nic has assembled a formidable team. His coasting to the second highest score on the week is but a peek into what he will be capable 
of this year.


## Chris 111.66 -- Ivona 78.12

### Good Gosh Josh

How could you not feel for Ivona. On her maiden voyage into the pristine waters of this most lovely of fantasy football leagues, she arrives at her first match up, and has to face an 
**tsunami** of fantasy points from &#127754; who else &#127754; Josh Allen. Few players are capable of detonating for 35+ points like Allen, and of course Ivona had to be the victim of the very first 
Josh Stallion stampede of the year.

But you may be saying to yourself "but wait, dearest commissioner!! Ivona has a superstar quarterback herself! And Joe Burrow actually threw for *more* yards and touchdowns than Josh Allen last year!!" 
Alas, my dear friends, Joe Sheisty did not have his sea legs ready for this start of the season. 
The trope of Joe Burrow starting the season off slowly held true once again in this week 1 of 2025, and he could not even muster up double digit fantasy points.

But!! But but but! Before you go writing off Ivona, there is a hero emerging in this story for her team... one that is poised to right the ship on her fantasy season and guide her through the treacherous 
waters that lie ahead. PUKA NACUA!!! &#9875; &#9973;

Now, you may be wondering what's up with the excessive use of the sea-faring puns. It is because the dashing Puka Nacua practically became a pirate this week as he 
suffered a _nasty_ injury to his face, complete with a battle scar in the form of a gash above his eye. 

![Yarrr puka](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/yarrr_puka.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

It was truly horrible, gushing blood everywhere. Puka had to leave the game _twice_ to get his eye cleaned and patched up. And yet, he _still_ came right back into the game and immediately 
dominated upon returning to the field. Despite the injury, and despite the fact that the Rams added hall-of-famer Davante Adams to their receiving corps, Puka led the Rams in targets, 
receptions, and *YARRRRds* (too much? okay yeah probably). 



## Sophie and Dan 109.64 -- Drew 81.22

### King Henry Returns for More Heads


You do know what they say: if you are going to aim for the king, _you'd better not miss_. &#127503;

And ohh the misery, Bo Nix did _a lot_ of missing for Sophie and Dan this week. Going up against a Tennessee Titans defense that is supposedly among the weakest in the league, he missed _fifteen_ 
throws and even had two of them get _intercepted_... by the Titans! As if that were not enough, he also fumbled away another possession to the Titans defense!!

To have such a disasterous performance -- right on the weekend of Dan's birthday no less (HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!) -- was such a shame. &#129318;

Luckily, Bo's week 1 ineptitude did not matter, because the king was on _his_ side.

We must give credit, Drew's team put up a most commendable effort: Jayden Daniels proved his rookie season was not a fluke, and Sam LaPorta managed to crack double digit points 
without the aid of a touchdown -- what a triumph for a tight end! All of which allowed Drew to overcome mediocre performances from his top two draft picks -- Amon Ra St. Brown and Malik Nabers -- and remain competitive late into Sunday's festivities.

But then the king reclaimed his throne. &#128081; &#128170;

Derrick Henry returned under the Sunday Night lights with a vengeance. It did not matter that he was going up against the Buffalo Bills _in_ Buffalo. You think 
a stampeding herd of buffalo is a terrifying sight?? Try staring down King Henry running full speed at you, over two hundred and fifty pounds of muscle and majesty, hurtling forward at speeds exceeding 
21 miles per hour, all accompanied by a stiff-arm forged from pure, weapons-grade steel.

Drew did not stand a chance. The aforementioned foibles of Nabers and St. Brown proved to be too steep of a ditch to climb out of and survive the onslaught from Derrick Henry. 

	&#128081; Long live the King!!!	&#128081;

## Sam and James 104.62 -- Alex 83.28

### CeeDee's Points Staying on the Champ's Bench?


Now friends, the question simply must be asked: what is the ohhh-sooo secret recipe for toppling a reigning champion? Well, whatever harrowing concoction it is, 
the marvelous, magical tag-team of Sam and James absolutely mastered it in Week 1 -- taking down our reigning champ Alex in decisive fashion right out of the gates!


So how did they do it? Ohh let me tell you this most devious of plans that they hatched.

The end game of their feindish trickery? Get into the head of the champion -- create an environment of total chaos and confusion. 

- First, they deployed Kyren Williams, one of Alex's favorite players from her championship team last year. But this time he's being used _against_ her... Can you say internal conflict?? 
This undoubtedly led to a heightened emotional state for the champion.

- Second, they built up an early lead during Thursday and Friday night football, inducing a sense of urgency in the champion. Both CeeDee Lamb and Patrick Mahomes put on fantastical displays 
Thursday and Friday respectively, and gave Sam and James a formidable lead heading into the weekend.

- Last, and most wickedly cunning of all... Sam and James put the __Denver Broncos defense__ in their lineup. For those of you who might not remember: two years ago, Alex was eliminated from the playoff semi-finals because she played 
the Broncos defense and they gave her __negative points__. Ever since that day the Broncos defense has been the bain of Alex's existence, nothing in this world fills her with more pure and utter __loathing__ than the Broncos defense.

What did this series of maneuvers from Sam and James result in? Alex was left in total confusion and disarray. She neglected to start her highest scoring runningback, and also left __both__ of 
her top two scoring wide receivers on her bench as well. So many points left unrealized as the reigning champion and proven fantasy football mastermind tried -- perhaps too hard -- to outwit her opponent.


![Alex zay fishes](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/alex_zay_fishes.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}


The unfortunate part of all of this for the rest of us is that these tactics are unlikely to work again when it comes to defeating Alex, and her impressive bench points are evidence that her roster is indeed still very potent.

Also, it is clear that not only have Sam and James assembled a formidable roster this year, but they also have spent the offseason training in the dark arts of fantasy football mindgames... 
your beloved commissioner will be doing a lot of meditating this week to stay mentally resilient, as I have to face them in week 2.



## Nick 74.72 -- Caitlin 68.98

### Not so Nice for Worthy

Caitlin was riding high after Thursday night football. 

The Eagles unveiled their Superbowl LIX championship banner, beat those ugly, atrocious Cowboys, and provided her fantasy football team with 
a most delightful lead in fantasy football thanks to Jalen #SuperbowlMVP Hurts outscoring Dak #FirstSpitter Prescott 24 to 7.

She was soaring _ohh so high_!! Off to a _spectaculocious_  start to the fantasy football season... and then **TRAVIS KELCE CLIPPED HER WINGS**.

Before Xavier Worthy could score a single fantasy point for her team, Travis Kelce absolutely steamrolled him in a gastly collision that dislodged Xavier's whole arm from the rest of his body. 


**The horror!!!** What could have possessed Travis to do such a thing?? 

He's the human exclamation point, one of the most universally beloved people by all players in the National Football League!! 
Why would he do this to poor Xavier, and by extention to Caitlin??

Many are saying this instance of friendly fire was clearly an honest mistake, a miscommunication between Worthy and Kelce. 

This definitely _appears_ to be the most likely explanation, they were playing 
in Brazil, perhaps both Travis and Xavier were slightly disoriented -- perhaps that mysterious Coriolis effect was to blame? 

But there _is_ an alternative explanation. One that is perhaps more blasphemous and unsavory. 

On his recent, widely publicized podcast with his now-fiancee, Travis Kelce got signs from his beloved Taylor Swift that _Xavier Worthy_ is actually one of her favorite 
players on the Chiefs. She purportedly erupted in excitement when the Chiefs first drafted the speedster receiver. 

Is it possible that Travis was consumed with jealousy?? 
Does he believe his wife-to-be should only have _one_ favorite player? We really mustn't speculate, these are horrid thoughts.

![Worthy plotting trav](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/worthy_plotting_trav.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

On the other end of this matchup, Nick acted quickly and took advantage of the opening created by the Worthy injury. 
It should be noted that he marched on to a clean victory, and proved that he is among the most dignified of fantasy football managers. 

Even though Nick heard news that the **man**, the **myth**, the **legend**, BILL CROSKEY, was in fact ready to make his football debut, Nick chose to leave him sidelined on his bench -- clearly out of 
respect to not run up the score on Xavier Worthy and Caitlin. 

The rest of us applaud you, Nick!! This was a positively honorific display of class and sportsmanship.
