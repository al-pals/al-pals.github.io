Without further adeu, my dearest pals of Als, I must insist that we begin this year with an honoring of our **fantabulous** reigning champion, **ALEX!!** 


Did she have brains or knowledge? **Indubitably!!**
She had an absolute abundance of ball knowledge put on full display as she not only won the league... conquering all of the most treacherous of challenges this league could possibly serve up. 
Fun fact alert - for the entire, storied history of this fantasy football league, **nobody** has overcome more points being scored against them and still manage to emerge victorious as league champion.
Alex isnâ€™t just a champion, she is the most determined, most resilient, most positively _ferocious_ champion this league has _ever, ever_ seen!!

Does anyone have the gumption needed to take down this dazzling dynamo?!? I would recommend the most extreme caution for all of you daring to take on the task.

That challenge begins for all of us **THIS TUESDAY** at 8PM Eastern (5PM Arizona time and 6PM Colorado time) with our **FANTASY FOOTBALL DRAFT**. 
Thanks to our intrepid Vice Commissioner Woody our draft order has been selected, and it we are sure to have a _soaring_ start 
with the first pick belonging to our resident superfan of the **SUPERBOWL LIX CHAMPION** Philadelphia Eagles - CAITLIN!!!

We could not be more excited for this draft and invite all who are able to [join us on zoom for this draft (link to zoom here)!!](https://ncsu.zoom.us/j/93077515043?pwd=K3Mh6FTozVa0OICJHxKCdrUrpQ0Nw3.1)
