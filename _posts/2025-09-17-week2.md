I come to you for this week 2 recap with an uneasy conscience. 

As we covered here last week in the week 1 recap, an investigation has begun into the dealings of our beloved, most handsome 
Vice Commissioner, Woody. Early last week, after the women of our fantasy football league inexplicably struggled to secure victories in week 1, 
claims began to surface that Woody was a rampant misogynist acting covertly to sabotage the women of this league. 

Well the investigation has exploded this past week, as more and more evidence of impropriety begins to mount against the Vice Commissioner. 
In Week 2, the struggles for the women in our league got even worse. 

This weekend, *every woman in our league came out on the losing end of their matchup*... except for one. 

This evidence on its own may seem damning enough for the Woody boi, but trust me it gets 
worse once we look deeper into the one woman who was spared in this week 2 onslaught of patriarchal devastation.

What if I were to tell you that this lone victor among the women of the league happened to be *Caitlin*? 
That's right the one and only mother of Woody's favoritest boyfriend (and rumored *lover*?), Gilmore!!
How convenient it is that *she* was the one to emerge from this past week unscathed... 


In the wake of these developments, our tireless photojournalists have unearthed this most incriminating picture of Gilmore and Woody at a secret meeting where they *could* have been contriving an entire scheme to rig the 
fantasy football league:

The authorities have decided that this cannot go on any longer without getting some concrete answers from Woody on these very serious of questions. 
Vice Commissioner Woody has officially been apprehended and brought in for this questioning.

Let's hope that we can achieve a resolution to this whole fiasco next week. But until then, here is your Week 2 Recap:

## Drew 152.60 -- Ivona 103.44

### Joever Before it Started

OHH THE HUMANITY!!! A catastrophe has befallen our newest league member. 

After a rough first week, Ivona showed that, while she may be the rookie here, her competitive zeal and sly instincts are 
that of a seasoned fantasy football warrior.

Ivona attacked the waiver wire with the *utmost* aggression, refusing to allow a loss in week 1 set the tone for her season. 
And her moves were not just aggressive, but fruitful!! Her prize acquisition, Quentin Johnston, put on a show in Monday Night 
Football and proved that he has emerged as the favorite deep ball target for the red-hot Justin Herbert.

Everything looked like Ivona was ready to flip the script on her early season misgivings. These new additions were doing their job, 
her team's fearless leader Puka Nacua was once again dominating. And then tragedy... 

Just as the tide appeared to be shifting for Ivona, Joe Burrow sustained a severe toe injury that will leave him sidelined for 
most, if not all, of the remainder of the season. 

This game that we play can be ohh so cruel some times. 

However, if the rest of us learned anything from last week, it's that Ivona is not one to be counted out. 
She's already proven her ability to respond to adversity!! She has now been forced to place her trust in Daniel Jones, but if anyone can make it work, I have no doubts that Ivona can.

While the loss of Burrow is undeniably the most cruel fate to befall Ivona this week. A not-so-distant second is the fact that, 
for two consecutive weeks to kick of her fantasy football career she has had to face the highest-scoring player in all of fantasy football. 
Last week it was Josh Allen, and then this week it was Drew's Amon-Ra Saint Brown.

As for Drew, Amon-Ra's 34.7 points was merely the tip of the iceberg, as his whole team exploded for our
league's **first 150 point week of the season**!!! What a magnificent display. 


## Armon 146.68 -- Nick 81.74

### The Year of Beer Rages On

When it rains it pours!!! And this year it's **pouring Beer**. 
Armon's masterful display in week 1, powered by the breakout campaign of Madison Beer's new love interest, Justin Herbert, continued in week 2 without skipping a beat. 

In fact, not only did Armon's dominance continue, it spread!! 
Now Armon's whole team looks like they're about to have career years and break out to new levels of stardom!!! 
And many of them are succeeding in the most precarious -- nay inexplicable -- circumstances.

Tetairoa McMillan?? He's *clearly* not succeeding because the Panthers are any good... they still suck!! But Tetairoa is so good that [even his unsuccessful catches are some of the Panthers' best highlights.](https://x.com/Nate_Tice/status/1967355446509052190)

Christian McCaffrey?? The entire San Fransisco 49ers roster is on Injured Reserve right now. But *not* the famously injury-prone CMC?! He's actually thriving somehow?!?

Rome Odunze? The Bears are winless through two weeks of football and everyone is ridiculing the quarterback Caleb Williams endlessly. But inspite of this ineptitude Odunze is breaking out??

Emeka Egbuka is on a team with not one but *two* future hall-of-fame wide recievers, and yet -- as a rookie -- *he* is leading all of them in fantasy points through two weeks!

Could this all *possibly* be just a coincidence? I fear not. I fear the year of Beer is upon us, and it's made Armon's entire team a juggernaut that the rest of us will have to contend with.

![Fear the beer](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/fear_the_beer.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

On the flip side, it appears Dak's had the opposite effect as a leader of Nick's team. 
After Dak kicked off his season by spitting at the Eagles' Jalen Carter, he ended up facing no consequences from the NFL! 


Unfortunately for Nick, it appears Dak did not evade judgement afterall. The bad karma of Dak's misplaced mucus has fallen upon the rest of Nick's fantasy team.
This week, not a single one of his runningbacks or wide receivers managed to crack double digits!



## Albert 137.00 -- Sam and James 113.86

### Even Salem Can't Save You Now

As you might remember from last week. 
Sam and James put on a masterful display of devious mind games in their defeat of our reigning champion, Alex.

Given that I was next up on their schedule, you already know that your precocious commissioner did not take the task lightly as I headed into this matchup with this cunning duo. 

My attempts at steadying my mind and mastering meditation were extreme, and they ultimately took me deep to the frosty tundra of north Wisconsin. 
There, I found council in a group of wise — if eccentric — women.

These women tought me their ways and showed me their secrets. And it was from this coven that I emerged with a new fantasy football weapon in week 2… *witchKraft*. 

![Tucker witchkraft 1](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/tucker_witchkraft_1.JPG){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

That’s right, it turns out that the secret to defeating wit and ingenuity is resorting to spells and potions… and mine came in the form of Green Bay Packers tight end, Tucker Kraft. 

If you think Elphaba Thropp can defy gravity, just check out my guy Tucker as he effortlessly leaps over defenders and stadium walls alike. 

Consider the rest of yourselves warned, Tucker Kraft is coming for all of you. And standing at 6-foot-5 and weighing *260* pounds, this witch isn’t just green and wicked… he’s **hefty**!!

## Chris 110.62 -- Sophie and Dan 76.88

### Checkmated by Chubb

King Henry was absolutely majestic in week 1. Derrick looked like there was not a human on Earth that could bring him down once he got that football in his hand and started charging.

But then the page turned to week 2, and all of a sudden, he appeared trapped!! 
In spite of the fact he was playing the lowly Cleveland Browns, Derrick Henry could not find any space -- not a singular space -- to move.

![CA queens gambit](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/ca_queens_gambit.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Yes, the abominable King Henry was put into checkmate and successfully neutralized this week by none other than our own Christopher Anderson. 
Who not only found a way to avoid getting demolished by the wrecking ball that is Derrick Henry, but also appears to have dusted off a wrecking ball of his own in Nick Chubb.


He may be old, beaten, and battered, but Nick Chubb has surged into this season showing new life after the cataclysmic knee injury that ended his career in Cleveland and threatened to end his career in totality.

Chris refused to give up on Mr. Chubb. And now it appears to be paying dividends. 
While this Houston version of Nick Chubb is not the same strapping, explosive runningback of yore, he's out to prove to us all that he still has gas left in the tank, and was a screaming value in our fantasy draft.

## Nic 101.92 -- Alex 89.00

### Things Ain't Goin' How They're 'Post to Be

Unlike the ohh-so-smooth [00's R&B star Omarion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPxVSCfoYnU), 
things are not going how they are supposed to be for *expected* rookie sensation Omarion Hampton and our defending champion, Alex.

This matchup between Nic and Alex was neck-and-neck the entire way as the lead went back and forth all weekend. 
It all came down to the last game Monday night, where Omarion Hampton was tasked with putting on a show to win Alex the week under the fluorescent lights of the Las Vegas strip against the Raiders. 
If Hampton could dazzle under the lights and surpass his expected point total, Alex would claim her first win of the season. If not? Doom! Disaster. Despair!


Alas, Omarion proved that he was *not* ready for the big stage. 
While he was undoubtedly not the only young lad bumbling and stumbling -- only to not make it very far -- in Las Vegas Monday night, 
he was the only one who cost our champion a shot at her first victory. 

This is clearly a great disappointment, but the real question that emerges here is: How did our **reigning champion** not see this coming? 
Why did she have the confidence to start a player *this* uninspiring?

If you are looking for someone to blame, I fear you need not look any further than your beloved, dashing commissioner. 
You see, since wooing Alex into marriage with my *limitless* charm and witty banter, I have entrapped her into attending an absolute glut of UNC sporting events. 


Among these has been many UNC football games in recent years, where she got to see a certain star runningback look simply bigger, stronger, and faster than everyone 
else on the football field -- that's right, Mr. Omarion Hampton himself. 

Unfortunately for Alex, when it came time to draft this year, she 
remembered how impressive Omarion looked on the football field, but seemed to forget that this was against the backdrop of UNC football. Which was *always* losing. 
And doing so in the most embarrassing fashion you could ever think imaginable.


When UNC football was losing to James Madison University by a score of 70 to 50, Omarion looked like he was carrying an entire football team 
on his back... but of course he had to carry that team! They were so bad that they **lost to James Madison SEVENTY TO FIFTY**!!!

![Alex jmu hampton](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/Alex_jmu_hampton.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

On the other end of this matchup, Nic's Javonte Williams continues to prove that he is the Tar Heel runningback that we should have been focused in on during the draft, and he is looking 
like the clear steal of the draft through two weeks of football!!



## Caitlin 91.64 -- Amy 77.72

### JJ McCarthy Brotherly Shoved into Locker

You may have learned in your American history courses that McCarthyism was among the most heinous gaslighting campaigns in the history of this country -- 
politicians going about accusing their opponents of being communist spies in an effort to manipulate the public. Well let me tell you -- McCarthyism 2.0 may have been 
even more heinous. 

After appearing to be a competent quarterback for a total of *one quarter of a football game* in Week 1, the national media decided 
to anoint JJ McCarthy as the next superstar QB. 

These buffoons were speculating whether it was McCarthy who was 
the true star among the sophomore quarterbacks, instead of Jayden Daniels and Drake Maye \* *scoffs violently* \*. Don't make me *laugh*.

These preposterous pundits even went so far as to name JJ McCarthy the *NFC Player of the Week* in Week 1 -- on the same week that Jalen Hurts hoisted a Superbowl Championship banner and 
humiliated the Cowtoys in prime time!!

![McCarthyism is treason](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/mccarthyism_is_treason.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Then came Week 2 of Sunday Night Football, and the clock struck midnight on the media's precious Cinderella JJ McCarthy. 

JJ turned the ball over *three* different times and failed to score a single touchdown!! 
And our poor Amy was left holding the rotting pumpkin. 

Who could have blamed Amy for believing the 
stories being told of a burgeoning star in Minnesota? Don't we all want to believe in fairytales?! 
Tragically, it was all for not, and Amy learned the hard way that these stories were nothing more than vicious lies.


Meanwhile, Caitlin's squadron of Eagles players wasted no time avenging Jalen Hurts for getting snubbed for NFC Player of the Week. As they 
displayed their true dominance by -- quite literally -- steamrolling the Chiefs in Arrowhead.

The Eagles ran the Tush Push **seven times** en route to victory, and had all of those same aformentioned NFL media members crying all evening 
proclaiming how it just isn't fair that the Eagles can run a play that cannot be stopped. Well, maybe if their darling JJ McCarthy had a Tush worth 
Pushing we wouldn't be in this predicament!!
