I come to you in this week 2 recap with a heavy heart. As we covered here last week in the week 1 recap, an investigation has begun into the dealings of our beloved, most handsome 
Vice Commissioner Woody. Early last week after the women of our fantasy football league inexplicably struggled to secure victories in week 1, 
claims began to surface that Woody was a rampant misogynist acting covertly sabotage the women of this league. 

Well the investigation has exploded as more and more evidence of impropriety begins to mount for the Vice Commissioner. This week, the struggles for the women in our league got even worse. 

In week 2, *every woman in our league came out on the losing end of their match up*... except for one. This evidence on its own may seem damning enough for the Woody boi, but trust me it gets 
worse. 

What if I were to tell you that this lone victor among the women of the league happened to be **Caitlin**? That's right the mother of Woody's favoritest boyfriend (and rumored *lover*?), Gilmore!!
How convenient that she was the one spared from this scourge of losing that came to all of the other women... 


What's more, in the wake of these developments, our tireless photojournalists have unearthed this damning picture of Gilmore and Woody at a secret meeting where they **could** have been contriving this whole scheme to rig the 
fantasy football league:

The authorities have decided that his cannot go on any longer without getting some concrete answers to these serious questions. 
Vice Commissioner Woody has officially been apprehended and brought in for questioning.

Let's hope that we can achieve a resolution to this whole fiasco next week. But until then, here is your Week 2 Recap:

## Drew 152.60 -- Ivona 103.44

### Joever Before it Started

OHH THE HUMANITY!!! What a catastrophe that has befallen our newest league member. After a rough first week, Ivona
showed that, while she may be the rookie here, her competitive zeal and cunning instincts are 
that of a seasoned fantasy football warrior.

Ivona attacked the waiver wire with maximum aggression, refusing to allow a loss in week 1 set the tone for her season. 
And her moves were not just aggressive, but fruitful!! Her prize acquisition Quentin Johnston put on a show in Monday Night 
Football and proved that he has emerged as the favorite deep ball target for the red-hot Justin Herbert.

Everything looked like Ivona was ready to flip the script on her early season. These new additions were doing their job, 
her team's fearless leader Puka Nacua was once again leading the charge. And then tragedy... ohh Joe say it aint so... a toe?!

Just as the tide appeared to be turning for Ivona, Joe Burrow sustained a severe toe injury that will leave him sidelined for 
most if not all of the remainder of the season. This game that we play can be ohh so cruel some times. Though, if the rest of us learned anything 
from last week, it's that Ivona is not one to count out. She's already proven her ability to respond to adversity!!

While the loss of Burrow is undeniably the most cruel fate to befall Ivona this week. A not-so-distant second is the fact that, 
for the second week in a row she had to go against the highest-scoring player in all of fantasy football. Where it was 
Josh Allen last week, this week it was Drew's Amon-Ra Saint Brown.

As for Drew, Amon-Ra's 34.7 points was merely the tip of the iceberg, as his whole team exploded for our
league's **first 150 point week of the season**!!! What a magnificent display. 


## Armon 146.68 -- Nick 81.74

### The Year of Beer Rages On

When it rains it pours!!! And this year it's **pouring Beer**. 
Armon's masterful display in week 1 powered by the breakout campaign of Madison Beer's new boyfriend Justin Herbert continued in week 2 without skipping a beat. 

In fact, not only did Armon's dominance continue, it spread!! 
Now Armon's whole team looks like they're about to have career years and break out to new levels of stardom!!! And many of them are succeeding in the most precarious -- nay inexplicable -- circumstances.

Tetairoa McMillan?? He's *clearly* not succeeding because the Panthers are any good... they still suck!! But Tetairoa is so good that [even his unsuccessful catches are some of the Panthers' best highlights.](https://x.com/Nate_Tice/status/1967355446509052190)

Christian McCaffrey?? The entire San Fransisco 49ers roster is on Injured Reserve right now. But *not* the famously injury-prone CMC?! He's actually thriving somehow?!?

Rome Odunze? The Bears are winless through two weeks of football and everyone is ridiculing the quarterback Caleb Williams endlessly. But inspite of this ineptitude Odunze is breaking out??

Emeka Egbuka is on a team with not one but *two* future hall-of-fame wide recievers, and yet -- as a rookie -- *he* is leading all of them in fantasy points through two weeks?!

Could this all *possibly* be just a coincidence? I fear not. I fear the year of Beer is upon us, and it's made Armon's entire team a juggernaut that the rest of us will have to contend with.

![Fear the beer](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/fear_the_beer.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

On the flip side, it appears Dak's had the opposite effect as a leader of Nick's team. 
After Dak kicked off his season by spitting at the Eagles' Jalen Carter, he ended up facing no consequences from the NFL! 


While you may think Dak escaped judgement, it appears the bad karma of this escapade has fallen upon the rest of Nick's fantasy team.
This week, none of his runningbacks nor wide receivers managed to crack double digits this week!



## Albert -- Sam and James

### Even Salem Can't Save You Now

As you might remember from last week. 
Sam and James put on a masterful display of wicked mind games in their defeat of our reigning champion, Alex.

As I was next up on their schedule, rest assured that your precocious commissioner did not take the task lightly as I headed into this match up with this cunning duo. 
My attempts at meditation and preparation were extreme, ultimately taking me deep to the frosty tundra of north Wisconsin. 
There, I found council in a group of wise — if eccentric — women.

These women tought me their ways and showed me their secrets. And it was from this coven that I emerged with a new fantasy football weapon for week 2… **witchKraft**. 

That’s right, it turns out that the secret to defeating wit and ingenuity is resorting to spells and potions… and mine came in the form of a breakout performance from Green Bay Packers tight end, Tucker Kraft. 
If you think Elphaba Thropp can defy gravity, just check out my guy Tucker as he leaps over defenders and stadium walls with ease. 

Consider the rest of yourselves warned, Tucker Kraft is coming for all of you. And standing at 6-foot-5 and weighing *260* pounds, this witch isn’t just green and wicked… he’s **hefty**!!

## Chris 110.62 -- Sophie and Dan 76.88

### Checkmated by Chubb

King Henry was absolutely majestic in week 1. Derrick looked like there was not a human on earth that could bring him down once he got that football in his hand and started charging.

But then this week, all of a sudden, he was trapped!! In spite of the Ravens playing the lowly Cleveland Browns, Derrick Henry could not find any space -- not a singular space -- to move.

Yes, the abominable King Henry was put into checkmate and successfully neutralized this week by none other than our own Christopher Anderson. 
Who not only found a way to prevent himself from getting demolished by the wrecking ball that is Derrick Henry, but also appears to have found his own wrecking ball for destruction in Nick Chubb.


![CA queens gambit](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/ca_queens_gambit.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

He may be old, beaten, and battered, but Nick Chubb has surged into the season showing new life after his cataclysmic knee injury that ended his career in Cleveland and threatened to end his career in totality.

Chris refused to give up on Mr. Chubb. And now it appears to be paying dividends. 
While this Houston version of Nick Chubb is not the same strapping, explosive runningback of yore, he's out to prove to us all that he still has gas left in the tank, and was a screaming value in our fantasy draft.

## Nic 101.92 -- Alex 89.00

### Things Ain't Goin' How They're 'Post to Be[R&B star Omarion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPxVSCfoYnU)

Unlike the ohh-so-smooth 00's R&B star Omarion, things are not going how they are supposed to be for *expected* rookie sensation Omarion Hampton and our defending champion Alex.

This match up between Nic and Alex was neck-and-neck the entire way as the lead went back and forth all weekend. 
It all came down to the last game Monday night, where Omarion Hampton was tasked with putting on a show to win Alex the week under the fluorescent lights of the Las Vegas strip against the Raiders. 
If Hampton could dazzle under the lights and surpass his expected point total, Alex would claim her first win of the season. If not? Doom! Disaster. Despair!


Alas, Omarion proved that he was *not* ready for the big stage. 
While he was undoubtedly not the only young man bumbling and stumbling in Las Vegas Monday night, he was the only one who cost our champion a shot at her first victory. 

Though this is clearly a great disappointment, the real question is: How did our reigning 
champion not see this coming? Why did she have the confidence to start a player *this* uninspiring?

If you are looking for someone to blame, I fear you need not look any further than your beloved, dashing commissioner. 
You see, since wooing Alex into marriage with my *limitless* charm and witty banter, I have entrapped her into attending an absolute glut of UNC sporting events. 


Among these has been many UNC football games in recent years, where she got to see a certain star runningback look simply bigger, stronger, and faster than everyone 
else on the football field -- that's right, Mr. Omarion Hampton himself. 

Unfortunately for Alex, when it came time to draft this year, she 
remembered how impressive Omarion looked on the football field, but seemed to forget that this was against the backdrop of UNC football. Which was *always* losing. 
And always losing in the most embarrassing fashion you could ever think to imagine.


Perhaps it was nothing more than an optical illusion that made Hampton look like a star? 
When UNC football was losing to James Madison University by a score of 70 to 50, Omarion looked like he was carrying an entire football team 
on his back... but of course he had to carry that team! They were so bad that they **lost to James Madison SEVENTY TO FIFTY**!!!

On the other end of this match up, Nic's Javonte Williams continues to prove that he is the Tar Heel runningback that we should have been focused in on during the draft, and is looking 
like the clear steal of the draft through two weeks of football!!



## Caitlin 91.64 -- Amy 77.72

### JJ McCarthy Brotherly Shoved into Locker

You may have learned in your American history courses that McCarthyism was among the most heinous gaslighting campaigns in the history of this country -- 
politicians going about accusing their opponents of being communist spies in an effort to manipulate the public. Well let me tell you -- McCarthyism 2.0 may have been 
even more heinous. 

After appearing to be a competent quarterback for a total of *one quarter of a football game* in Week 1, the national media decided 
to anoint JJ McCarthy as the next superstar QB. These buffoons were speculating whether it was McCarthy who was 
the true star among the sophomore quarterbacks, instead of Jayden Daniels and Drake Maye \* *scoffs violently* \*. Don't make me *laugh*.

They even named JJ McCarthy the *NFC Player of the Week* in Week 1 -- on the same week that Jalen Hurts hoisted a Superbowl Championship banner and 
humiliated the Cowtoys in prime time!!

![McCarthyism is treason](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/mccarthyism_is_treason.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Then came Week 2 of Sunday Night Football, and the clock struck midnight on the media's precious Cinderella JJ McCarthy. 

JJ turned the ball over *three* different times and failed to score a single touchdown!! 
And our poor Amy was left holding the rotting pumpkin. 

Who could have blamed Amy for believing the 
stories being told of a burgeoning star in Minnesota? Don't we all want to believe in fairytales?! 
Tragically, it was all for not, and Amy learned the hard way that these stories were nothing more than vicious lies.


Meanwhile, Caitlin's squadron of Eagles players wasted no time avenging Jalen Hurts for getting snubbed for NFC Player of the Week. As they 
displayed their true dominance by -- quite literally -- steamrolling the Chiefs in Arrowhead.

The Eagles ran the Tush Push **seven times** en route to victory, and had all of those same aformentioned NFL media members crying all evening 
proclaiming how it just isn't fair that the Eagles can run a play that cannot be stopped. Well, maybe if their darling JJ McCarthy had a Tush worth 
Pushing we wouldn't be in this predicament!!
