Incredible work everybody!! The draft was a massive success, and now the table is set for competition in the world's greatest fantasy football league to commence. To give you an idea of who you will be competing against this year, I will give you a fun **VERY TRUE** fact about each of the managers in our league this year, and our beloved Vice Commissioner, Woody, will help give you an idea on what the teams look like this year by providing us a draft grade for every team.



## Caitlin (@ccdougher3)

#### Team name: summer i turned SB LIX &#127942;

**Fun fact about Caitlin:** Noted Eagles superfan, Caitlin is such a lover of _the birds_ that she has recently decided to make a sharp career pivot to find more birds to fall in love with, and become a professional birder. She cannot get enough of the majestic beauty of these winged creatures and is especially fond of their incredible talent of defecating from high altitudes and with pinpoint accuracy onto the heads of passers by!!

**Woody's Draft Grade for Caitlin: A+**   
Caitlin, Gils mom, did an amazing job. Woody loves Gil, Gil loves the birds, Woody loves the birds. Go birds. Also, as if that was not enough... [WE DRAFTED XAVIER WORTHY!!!](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OQHisWYMzGs)



## Albert (@berttucci)

#### Team name: bert and the showgirls

**Fun fact about Albert:** After failing to complete my quest for a third consecutive fantasy football championship last year, I fell into a depression so deep that I needed to find a new pasttime that could lift me out of it. In the end, the only hobby that succeeded in lifting me out of this malaise was puppeteering. My newfound passion for puppets has been focused on the sock varietals so far, but I look forward to expanding into wood puppets should my fantasy football ineptitude continue this year.

**Woody's Draft Grade for Albert: C**
VERY CONFLICTING!! Travis _Hunter_ and Ja'marr _Chase_? Woody thinks Hunters are scary, but loves to play Chase...

## Chris (@cranderbro)

#### Team name: Just joshin'

**Fun fact about Chris:** Chris drafted via surrogate!! His close friend Matt stood in for him and took his young roster to term through the draft while Chris was focused on furthering his career. Intriguingly, this is not Chris' first experience with surrogacy, he's been a professional surrogate himself for a number of wealthy celebrity couples -- who must remain anonymous at this juncture due to various NDAs.

**Woody's Draft Grade for Chris: A+**
CA got Jordan _LOVE_, Matthew _GOLDEN_, and _Fancy Ladd_ McConkey all on the same team?? As a golden fancy lad who loves love, Woody APPROVES!!


## Nic (@nicengels)

#### Team name: BILL CROSKEY

**Fun fact about Nic:** The only thing Nic loves more than kicking butt in fantasy football is adding to his growing collection of socks &#129510;. Specifically _long_ socks. This obsession with long socks is relatively new, so the collection is still growing, but Nic's love of these longos is undeniable. The longer the better. It's actually gotten to the point where he's a bit revolted by socks that don't at *least* come up to the knee - why even have legs at that point? What are the longest socks you own? Bet you his are longer.

{: .box-success}
**Woody's Draft Grade for Nic: A**  
AJ Brown?!? AJ BROWN!! Also, Jahmyr Gibbs is a FAST BOI like Woody!!!




## Sam and James (@normalestman)

#### Team name: Jimmy G Choo

**Fun fact about Sam and James:** Sam and James are getting married this November!!! Congratulations!! They were so inspired by the Bezos wedding that rented out the entire city of Venice, but for a long time they were at a loss for how to follow up such a grandiose event. Then they found the solution: rent out a whole continent! But to ensure the wedding would not be too gauche, they went with the most modestly priced continent: Antarctica. The best part about this is that the penguins all already look like they're in tuxedos!

![Samjames penguins](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/jimmy_choo_penguin.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

{: .box-warning}
**Woody's Draft Grade for Sam and James: B**  
To start, very good job drafting Kermit the quarterback Mahomes -- he's going to be playing extra hard to be sure he's a groomsman at the Swift wedding. But then Woody is very worried about pronouncing all of those Nj names... Smith-Njigba and Njoku? Is it Njimmy Choo now? Does Woody have to change his name to Njoody? Is this a New Jersey thing?? Confoozed.



## Ivona (@ivonafilic)

#### Team name: ivonafilic

**Fun fact about Ivona:** Ivona is the newest member of our fantasy football league!!! The warmest of welcomes, Ivona!! Also, Ivona is in the midst of planning her own wedding to Nick!! So incredible and congratulations are yet again in order!! You might be thinking that this is a lot for one person to take on, all at once. Being a rookie in our fantasy league _and_ planning a wedding all at the same time is no small feat. But fear not!! Ivona is a master multitasker, she once spent an entire year as a traveling one-woman ensemble performing across the midwest.

![Ivona ensemble](https://al-pals.github.io/assets/img/ivona_band.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

{: .box-success}
**Woody's Draft Grade for Ivona: A+**  
TRAVYY MADE IT TO THE BIG GAME!!! CONGRATULATIONS ON DRAFTING MR. TAYLOR SWIFT AKA MR. AMERICANA AKA THE HUMAN EXCLAMATION POINT AKA MR. MOTHER ... or father? okay maybe nvm on that last one.


## Sophie and Dan (@centis)

#### Team name: Russell Wilson's Exes

**Fun fact about Sophie and Dan:** SOPHIE AND DAN ARE ENGAGED TOO!!!! SO MUCH LOVE IN THIS FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE, I need to catch my breath. Sophie and Dan are returning to our league after living in Durham, England &#127988; this past year! They were actually intending to move to North Carolina but after paying the security deposit on an apartment in the wrong Durham, they decided they would just bite the bullet.


{: .box-success}
**Woody's Draft Grade for Sophie and Dan: A+**  
Woody is BIG FAN OF GEORGE KITTLE!! First, he's named after food: AMAZING. Second, he loves his sniffs so much that he threatened to quit football if he couldn't sniff his salts... Woody also LOVES SNIFFS!! Third, George seems like goofy goober, Woody is big fan of goofy goobers.


## Amy (@acv1)

#### Team name: happy little bluebirds

**Fun fact about Amy:** Amy has taken up horse riding in recent years, and done so to *remarkable* success &#128014; &#128014;. Now, while racing is not exactly her greatest strength on the horse, after years of taking her daughter, Alex, to tumbling lessons, she has learned how to perform incredibly acrobatic gymnastic moves while on horseback. This talent is so incredible that she fully expects to medal in [_dressage_](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CniEbJXHDq8) at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games where she will dazzle the judges by showing off her ability to do a backflip on a horse!! (Pictured below.)

## Nick (@nickfenger)

#### Team name: Atticus the Platypus

**Fun fact about Nick:**

## Armon (@arm0nkey)

#### Team name: d. diddy

**Fun fact about Armon:** At his *stunning* wedding this past Spring, Armon and Samantha had the most impressive cake making ceremony you have ever seen. There was music, fanfare, and *FIREWORKS* while Armon and Samantha built the cake themselves!! &#127879; &#127874; Armon was such a fan of this experience that he decided to become a contestant on 'The Great British Bake Off'. Unfortunately, Armon very much misunderstood how critical _fireworks_ are to the typical process of making cakes, and was immediately disqualified from the competition when he started the first challenge by firing off roman candles at the other contestants.

**Woody's Draft Grade for Armon: D**  
Brock Bowers might have a very bad year. Every time Woody has to have hair removed, it's because he has to go to vet. Vet is HORRIBLE AND SCARY PLACE WHERE THEY TORTURE YOU. And based off of his hair, it looks like Brock spent ALL SUMMER AT THE VET!!! HOW IS HE SUPPOSED TO PLAY FOOTBALL NOW?!?


## Drew (@dhanford)

#### Team name: Deep Tissue

**Fun fact about Drew:** Drew is one of the best fantasy football managers in this entire league - nobody has scored more points over the total time of this league existing. And yet, Drew has still not yet succeeded in winning the championship! This is probably because he has been engulfed in a multi-year legal battle trying to protect his identity from being stolen completely. For years, we had two Drew Hanfords in this league, and identifying the authentic Drew from the imposter became and increasingly unweildy task. It got so bad that at one point - reportedly - Drew's own family began to question which was the real Drew. Well, after years of this torment, Drew is finally free!! The imposter revealed himself to be _Armon_ this whole time.

**Woody's Draft Grade for Drew: A+**  
Woody _loves_ to play in the sun and loves to play with his neighbor friends. Apparently Amon Ra Saint Brown is named after the sun **and** Drew also drafted Nabers?? Great job!!


## Alex (@avenuto3)

#### Team name: Paper rings where???


**Fun fact about Alex:** As many of you know, Alex is a bit of a Taylor Swift fan. As you also may know, Taylor Swift is now in a long-term relationship with Kansas City Chief's Tight End, Travis Kelce. What you might not know is that Travis Kelce's sister-in-law, Kylie Kelce, is an impressive athlete herself and currently coaches girls field hockey. Well, being a former collegiate hockey player herself, Alex now plans to become a field hockey coach herself as part of a scheme that could eventually connect her to Kylie, then to Travis, and ultimately to Taylor. Now, you might be thinking "wait, I thought Alex played _ice_ hockey not field hockey?"... well I'm sure they can't be _that_ different. You probably just have to tie your skates a little tighter so that they stay on in the grass.

**Woody's Draft Grade for Alex: A+**   
Mom drafted Woody's new favorite player, Colston LOVEland!! If you need further explanation... just [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/w045t8ylgUM) &#127798; &#129397;
