Incredible work everybody!! The draft was a massive success, and now the table is set for the grandest of competitions. To give you an idea of who you will be competing against this year, I will give you a fun **VERY TRUE** fact about each of the managers in our league this year, and Woody will help give you an idea on what the teams look like by providing us a draft grade for every team.



## Caitlin (@ccdougher3)

#### Team name: summer i turned SB LIX :trophy:

**Fun fact about Caitlin:** Noted Eagles superfan, Caitlin is such a lover of _the birds_ that she has recently decided to make a sharp career pivot to find more birds to fall in love with, and become a professional birder. She cannot get enough of the majestic beauty of these winged creatures and is especially fond of their incredible talent of defecating from high altitudes and with pinpoint accuracy onto the heads of passers by!!

**Woody's Draft Grade for Caitlin: A+**



## Albert (@berttucci)

#### Team name: bert and the showgirls

**Fun fact about Albert:** After failing to complete my quest for a third consecutive fantasy football championship last year, I fell into a depression so deep that I needed to find a new pasttime that could lift me out of it. In the end the only hobby that succeeded in lifting me out of this malaise was puppeteering. My newfound passion for puppets has been focused on the sock varietals so far, but I look forward to expanding into wood puppets should my fantasy football ineptitude continue this year.

## Chris (@cranderbro)

#### Team name: Easy, Breecey, Not OK

**Fun fact about Chris:** Chris is an expert on all things pickled. Think of any food item possible. If you take that food - and you _pickle it_ - you can blindfold Chris and have him taste it, and he will be able to tell you what the original food item was. You might find this hidden talent to be a bit bizarre and not all that impressive, well...

**Woody's Draft Grade for Chris: A+**


## Nic (@nicengels)

#### Team name: Shrek 5 coming 2026

**Fun fact about Nic:** Nic is a lover of *long* socks. The longer the better. It's actually gotten to the point where he's a bit revolted by socks that don't at **least** come to the knee. What are the longest socks you own? Bet you his are longer.

**Woody's Draft Grade for Nic: A+**


## Sam and James (@normalestman)

#### Team name: Jimmy G Choo

**Fun fact about Sam and James:** Sam and James are getting married this November!!! Congratulations!! They were so inspired by the Bezos wedding that rented out the entire city of Venice, but were for a long time at a loss for how to follow up such a grand event. But then they found the solution: rent out a whole continent! But to not be too gauche they went with the most modestly priced continent: Antarctica. Best part is the penguins all already look like they're in tuxedos!

**Woody's Draft Grade for Sam and James: A+**


## Ivona (@ivonafilic)

#### Team name: ivonafilic

**Fun fact about Ivona:** Ivona is the newest member of our fantasy football league!!! The warmest of welcomes, Ivona!! Also, Ivona is in the midst of planning her own wedding to Nick!! So incredible and congratulations are yet again in order!! You might be thinking this is a lot for her to take on, being a rookie in our fantasy league and planning a wedding all at the same time. But fear not, Ivona is a master multitasker, she once spent an entire summer as a traveling one-woman ensemble performing across the midwest.

**Woody's Draft Grade for Ivona: A+**


## Sophie and Dan (@centis)

#### Team name: Russell Wilson's Exes

**Fun fact about Sophie and Dan:** SOPHIE AND DAN ARE ENGAGED TOO!!!! SO MUCH LOVE IN THIS FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE, I need to catch my breath. Sophie and Dan are returning to our league after living in Durham, England this past year! They were actually intending to move to North Carolina but after paying the security deposit on an apartment in the wrong Durham, they decided they would just bite the bullet.

**Woody's Draft Grade for Sophie and Dan: A+**


## Amy (@acv1)

#### Team name: City Upon a Hill

**Fun fact about Amy:** Amy has taken up horse riding in recent years, and done so to *remarkable* success. Now, while racing is not exactly her greatest strength on the horse, after years of taking her daughter, Alex, to tumbling lessons, she has learned how to perform incredibly acrobatic gymnastic moves while on horseback. This talent is so incredible that she fully expects to medal in [_dressage_](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CniEbJXHDq8) at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games where she will dazzle the judges by showing off her ability to do a backflip on a horse!! (Pictured below.)

## Nick (@nickfenger)

## Armon (@arm0nkey)

#### Team name: d. diddy

**Fun fact about Armon:** At his *stunning* wedding this past Spring, Armon and Samantha had the most impressive cake building ceremony you have ever seen. There was music, fanfare, and **FIREWORKS**!! Armon was such a fan of this experience that he decided to become a contestant on 'The Great British Bake Off'. Unfortunately, Armon very much misunderstood how critical _fireworks_ are to the typical process of making cakes, and was immediately disqualified from the competition when he started the first challenge by firing off roman candles at the other contestants.

## Drew (@dhanford)

#### Team name: Deap Tissue


**Fun fact about Drew:**

**Woody's Draft Grade for Drew: A+**


## Alex (@avenuto3)

#### Team name: Fantasy football showgirl


**Fun fact about Alex:** As many of you know, Alex is a bit of a Taylor Swift fan. As you also might know, Taylor Swift is now in a long-term relationship with Kansas City Chief's Tight End Travis Kelce. What you might not know is that Travis Kelce's sister-in-law, Kylie Kelce, is an impressive athlete herself and currently coaches girls field hockey. Well, being a former collegiate hockey player herself, Alex now plans to become a field hockey coach her self as part of a scheme to eventually connect her to Kylie, then to Travis, and ultimately to Taylor. You might be thinking "wait, I thought Alex played _ice_ hockey not field hockey?"... well I'm sure they can't be _that_ different. You probably just have to tie your skates a little tighter so that they stay on in the grass.

**Woody's Draft Grade for Alex: A+** OHHH NOOO!!!! MOM GOT THE LAST PICK?!? ALL BECAUSE OF MEE!!!
