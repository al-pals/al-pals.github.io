Incredible work everybody!! We had the most splendiferous of drafts, and now the table is set for the grandest of competitions. To give you an idea of who you will be competing against this year, I will give you a fun **VERY TRUE** fact about each of the managers in our league this year, and Woody will help give you an idea on what the teams look like by providing us a draft grade for every team.

## Caitlin (@ccdougher3)

#### Team name: summer i turned SB LIX :trophy:




**Fun fact about Caitlin:** Caitlin is such a lover of _the birds_ that she has recently decided to make a sharp career pivot and become a professional birder. She cannot get enough of their majestic beauty and is especially fond of their incredible talent of defecating from high altitudes and with pinpoint accuracy onto passers by!!

**Woody's Draft Grade for Caitlin: A+**

## Albert (@berttucci)

#### Team name: bert and the showgirls

{: .box-note}
**Fun fact about Albert:** After failing to complete my quest for a third consecutive fantasy football championship last year, I fell into a depression so deep that I needed to find a new pasttime that could lift me out of it. In the end the only hobby that succeeded in lifting me out of this malaise was puppeteering. My newfound passion for puppets has been focused on the sock varietals so far, but I look forward to expanding into wood puppets should my fantasy football ineptitude continue this year.

## Chris (@cranderbro)

#### Team name: Easy, Breecey, Not OK

{: .box-note}
**Fun fact about Chris:** Chris is an expert on all things pickled. Think of any food item possible, you can blindfold Chris and have him taste it, and he can tell you what the original food item was. You might find this bizarre and not all that impressive, well...


## Nic (@nicengels)

#### Team name: Shrek 5 coming 2026

{: .box-note}
**Fun fact about Nic:** Nic is a lover of *long* socks. The longer the better. It's actually gotten to the point where he's a bit revolted by socks that don't at _least_ come up past the knee. What are the longest socks you own? Bet you his are longer.



## Sam and James (@normalestman)

#### Team name: Jimmy G Choo

{: .box-note}
**Fun fact about Sam and James:** Sam and James are getting married this November!!! Congratulations!! They were so inspired by the Bezos wedding that rented out the entire city of Venice, but were for a long time at a loss for how to follow up such a grand event. But then they found the solution: rent out a whole continent! But to not be too gauche they went with the most modestly priced continent: Antarctica. Best part is the penguins all already look like they're in tuxedos!


## Ivona (@ivonafilic)

#### Team name: ivonafilic

{: .box-note}
**Fun fact about Ivona:** Ivona is the newest member of our fantasy football league!!! The warmest of welcomes, Ivona!! Also, Ivona is in the midst of planning her own wedding to Nick!! So incredible and congratulations are yet again in order!! You might be thinking this is a lot for her to take on, being a rookie in our fantasy league and planning a wedding all at the same time. But fear not, Ivona is a master multitasker, she once spent an entire summer as a traveling one-woman ensemble performing across the midwest.

## Sophie and Dan (@centis)

#### Team name: Russell Wilson's Exes

{: .box-note}
**Fun fact about Sophie and Dan:** SOPHIE AND DAN ARE ENGAGED TOO!!!! SO MUCH LOVE IN THIS FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE, I need to catch my breath. Sophie and Dan are returning to our league after living in Durham, England this past year! They were actually intending to move to North Carolina but after paying the security deposit on an apartment in the wrong Durham, they decided they would just bite the bullet.
