What a _ga-lorious_ occasion!!! Autumn is hastily approaching and the fantasy football season is ready to commence. Let us all _rejoicify_ in this season of spectacle and splendor!!

Without further adeu, my dearest pals of Als, I must insist that we begin this year with an honoring of our **fantabulous** reigning champion, **ALEX**!! 
Did she have brains or knowledge? **Indubitably**!! 
She had an absolute abundance of ball knowledge put on full display as she not only won the league... she overcame some of the most difficult obstacles possible for a fantasy football manager. 
Fun fact alert - for the entire, storied history of this fantasy football league, nobody has overcome more points being scored against them to come out victorious as league champion.
Alex isnâ€™t just a champion, she is the most determined, most resilient, most positively ferocious champion this league has ever, ever seen!!
